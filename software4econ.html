<p>
The following software list is idiosyncratic.
I have tried to make it generally useful for economists.
I favor cross-platform solutions,
since I view the current near monopoly of the end-user operating system as a momentary historical aberration.
<a href="#contact">Suggested changes and additions</a> are welcome.

Two requests:
<ul>
<li>
If you use a free and open source software application,
please send money to the developers.
(Yes, this is an appeal by an economist to your moral sense. Live with it.)

<li>
Please read Richard Stallman's <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/right-to-read.html">Right to Read article</a>, as well as his <a href="http://www.gnu.org/gnu/manifesto.html">GNU Manifesto</a>.
Many people felt Stallman was over-concerned when he wrote this.
Events have been proving him prophetic:
including ebooks that “time out” and become inaccessible after fixed hours of viewing,
and perhaps most famously an ebook version of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland that forbade reading it aloud.

<h2 id="EDITORS">Text Editors</h2>

<p>
Serious coding calls for a serious text editor!
All other things equal, multi-platform solutions are always preferable.
</p>

<p id="vim">
I recommend <a href="http://www.vim.org">Vim</a>.
It is highly configurable,
available on essentially every platform
and quite wonderfully designed.
On top of all this, it is charityware:
you pay nothing for this excellent software,
but users are encouraged to make a donation for needy children in Uganda.  
However, many good choice exist,
including the very closely related <a href="https://neovim.io/">NeoVim</a>.
</p>

<h3>Some cross-platform editors:</h3>

<p>
Mode-based editing rocks!
However, it also takes practice.
If you choose Vim or NeoVim (recommended!),
be sure to do
<a href="http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/usr_01.html#vimtutor">the tutorial</a>
(or possibly <a href="https://www.openvim.com/">this online tutorial</a>).
</p>

<p class="boxed">
See <a href="#vimhints">Vim user hints.</a>
</p>

<p>
Python users may want to consider the interesting and powerful
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/python/installing-python-support-in-visual-studio?view=vs-2019#visual-studio-2017-and-2019">Python Tools for Visual Studio</a> in
<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a>.
(There is additionally a Vim editing mode.)
</p>

<p>
The elephant in the room is still
<a id="emacs" href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">GNU emacs</a>:
big, powerful, and free.
(Vincent Goulet offers a <a href="http://vgoulet.act.ulaval.ca/en/ressources/emacs/">modified emacs</a>
that is easy to install across platforms and is particularly useful for LaTeX users.)
Some prefer the closely related <a href="http://www.xemacs.org/index.html">XEmacs</a>
(but development on that has slowed).
Many users will find the somewhat less powerful but much smaller
<a href="http://www.bengtl.net/files/mg3a/">mg3a</a>
provides sufficient emacs style functionality.
</p>

<div>
There are many cross-platform alternatives.
See the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_text_editors">Wikipedia article</a>.
</div>

<div>
Windows users:
<br />
The NotePad editor is always available as an accessory program,
but it is rather limited for serious use.
If you like the basic interface,
try the fast and powerful <a href="http://www.scintilla.org/">Scintilla</a>-based <a href="http://notepad-plus-plus.org/">NotePad++</a>. (License: GPL)
For pure speed on a Windows platform there is the powerful <a href="http://www.vedit.com/">VEdit</a>.
If you can afford it, there is also
Lugaru's <a href="http://www.lugaru.com/lugaru.html">Epsilon</a>,
a powerful and fast yet lightweight editior with an extensive emacs-style command set.
</div>

<p>
Aside:
you can still get the <a href="http://ex-vi.sourceforge.net/">traditional vi editor</a>,
which has been <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=02/01/24/0146248">free and open source since 2002</a>.
</p>



<h3>Fonts</h3>

<h4 id="monospace">Monospaced Fonts</h4>

<p>
Once you have chosen your editor,
find a <a href="http://hivelogic.com/articles/top-10-programming-fonts">decent monospaced font</a>.
(Crucial for programming; always examine this character sequence: Il1aoe0O.)
My favorite is Andale Mono,
a TrueType font that I find exceptionally readable even at small font sizes.
There appears to be more than one
<a href="http://corefonts.sourceforge.net/">legal yet free distribution</a>,
due to the original licensing terms,
but you can also <a href="https://www.myfonts.com/collections/andale-mono-paneuropean-font-monotype-imaging">purchase the font</a>.
My second choice is the Unicode <a href="https://dejavu-fonts.github.io/">DejaVu</a> font family.
(Derivative from <a href="http://www.gnome.org/fonts/">Bitstream's Vera Fonts</a>;
available as a Latin-Cyrillic-Greek subset;
<a href="http://dejavu-fonts.org/wiki/License">License</a>)
Many people like the free and open source <a href="https://github.com/google/fonts/tree/master/ofl/inconsolata">Inconsolata</a>.
</p>

<div id="STIX">
Before listing more monospaced fonts,
I must note the wonderful  <a href="http://www.stixfonts.org/">Scientific and Technical Information Exchange (STIX)</a> font project.
These are "a comprehensive set of fonts that serve the scientific and engineering community".
and are available under a royalty free (and fairly liberal) license.
(TeX users should check these out!)
The fonts were released in May 2010 and updated in 2016.
</div>

<div>
Here are MiKTeX installation instructions from Ulrike Fischer:
<ol>
<li> 
Unpack the zip-file somewhere outside miktex. You will get a
folder stix-tds
</li>
<li> 
Add the folder stix-tds as a new root in miktex - settings, tab "roots"
</li>
<li> 
Activate the stix.map file either in a document with
<code>\pdfmapfile{=stix.map}</code> or globally by following the 
<a href="http://docs.miktex.org/2.9/manual/advanced.html#psfonts">instructions in the documentation</a>
</li>
<li> 
Test the font with this document:
<pre>
\documentclass{article}
%\pdfmapfile{=stix.map} %if the map file is not activated globally
\usepackage{stix}
\begin{document}
Some text, and a math formula \(a+b=\sqrt{c}\).
\end{document}
</pre>
</li> 
</ol>
</div>

<p>
A few more freely available mono-space fonts ...
<a href="https://www.google.com/get/noto/#sans-mono">
Google’s Noto Sans Mono</a> is getting very favorable reviews.
Most systems include some version of CourierNew,
which is mostly adequate,
or LucidaConsole, which is pretty good.
(Unfortunately, neither adequately distinguishes 0 from O.)
Another good choice from Adobe is <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/sourcecodepro.adobe/">Source Code Pro</a>,which in regular weight looks quite a bit like Andale Mono,
but which somewhat overweights its boldface font.
(OpenType, Latin-1 only; License: Open Font License 1.1)
Another popular font is <a href="http://damieng.com/blog/2008/05/26/envy-code-r-preview-7-coding-font-released">Envy Code R</a>. (True Type, Latin-1 and Latin-1 Supplement; License: gratis but not redistributable)
For more choices, filter on mono-spaced fonts at <a href="https://www.google.com/fonts">Google Fonts</a>
or <a href="http://www.fontsquirrel.com/">Font Squirrel</a>.
User ratings of “programming fonts” can be found on <a href="http://www.slant.co">Slant</a>.
The <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/freefont/">GNU FreeFont</a> mono-space fonts
are available as OpenType or TrueType.
Some people like <a href="http://www.marksimonson.com/fonts/view/anonymous-pro">Anonymous</a> (OFL).
There is also a more narrowly focused but very useful <a href="http://archive.vector.org.uk/art10002160">APL font (SImPL.TTF)</a>.
Those needing a small font-size might consider the <a href="http://tobiasjung.name/profont/">ProFont</a> bitmap font,
which looks great at 9pt.
(License: MIT)
</p>

<div>
Good commercial mono-space fonts:
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://www.evertype.com/emono/">Everson Mono Unicode</a> (good reputation for its Unicode support, but I find it difficult to read at small font sizes)
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.fsd.it/fonts/pragma.htm">Pragmata</a>
</li>
<li>
A popular option with good Unicode support is MicroSoft <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/fonts/family.aspx?FID=300">Consolas</a>,
which is an OpenType font.  
</li>
</ul>
</div>


<h4 id="fonts">Other Useful Fonts</h4>

<p>
<a href="http://www.sil.org/~gaultney/gentium/">Gentium Plus</a> is a high-quality
FOSS unicode font set with some math-symbol support.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/fonts/arev/doc/fonts/arev/">Arev</a>
fonts are designed to be useful for presentations containing math.
</p>


<h3 id="spell">Spell Checkers</h3>

<p>
The most natural approach to spell checking is modular,
but many editors nevertheless include their own spell checker.
If yours does not, there are many free options.
Perhaps the most obvious cross-platform option is 
<a href="http://aspell.sourceforge.net/">Aspell</a>.
(If you will use the <a href="http://aspell.net/win32/">Windows release</a>,
see <a href="#aspellhints">Aspell hints</a>.)
Aspell derives from the more famous
<a href="http://fmg-www.cs.ucla.edu/fmg-members/geoff/ispell.html">ispell</a>.
(There seem to be separate implementations of <a href="http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/support/ispell/">ispell for Unix and OS/2</a> and 
<a href="http://www.projectory.de/ispell/">ispell for Win95/NT</a>.
You can also try <a href="http://tug2.cs.umb.edu/tex-archive/support/jspell/">jspell</a>
in a DOS environment.)
If you need a spell checker for general Windows applications,
try <a href="http://ftp.pcworld.com/pub/new/business/other/apscinst.exe">All-Purpose Spell Checker</a> or
<a href="http://www.quinion.com/mqa/spell.htm">Spell Checker for Edit Boxes</a>.
(They are free.)
</p>

<p>
Vim 7+ includes a spell checker.
You can also <a href="http://www.fleiner.com/vim/spell.html">integrate Vim with aspell</a>,
which is my preference.
</p>

<!-- 
Dictionary and Thesaurus

Finally we could also integrate in a web browser to take us to our favorite dictionary and thesaurus site as follows:
    map <Leader>d <Esc>:silent !mozilla http://www.m-w.com/<CR>
or to send the current word
    map <Leader>d <Esc>:silent !mozilla "http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/ Dictionary?book=Dictionary&va=<cword>"<CR>
    map <Leader>d <Esc>:silent !mozilla "http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/ Thesaurus?book=Thesaurus&va=<cword>"<CR>

For Windows and the Cygwin environment you will need the following syntax:
    map <Leader>d <Esc>:silent !start mozilla http://www.m-w.com/<CR>
    map <Leader>d <Esc>:silent !start mozilla "http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/ Dictionary?book=Dictionary&va=<cword>"<CR>
    map <Leader>d <Esc>:silent !start mozilla "http://www.m-w.com/cgi-bin/ Thesaurus?book=Thesaurus&va=<cword>"<CR>

There are two new syntax items in the line above. The "silent" suppresses output from the command we invoke and the "start" for the Windows platforms runs the program in the background so we can continue the edit session. The silent option is not available in the vi editor.


//Name this file spellcheck.js and make a shortcut to it on your browser
oShell= new ActiveXObject("WScript.Shell");
oShell.SendKeys("^c" ); //copy
oWord= new ActiveXObject("Word.Application");
oWord.Visible= true;
oWord.Documents.Add();
oWord.Selection.Paste();
oWord.ActiveDocument.CheckSpelling();
oWord.Selection.WholeStory();
oWord.Selection.Copy();
oWord.ActiveDocument.Close(0);
oWord.Quit();
var nRet= oShell.Popup("Apply changes?\nClick OK to replace all selected text.",0,"Spell Check Complete",33);
if (nRet==1){
 oShell.SendKeys("^v");//paste
 }
-->


<h3>Dictionaries and Thesauri</h3>

<p>
These days, your favorite dictionaries and thesauri are probably available free online.
My favorite crowd-sourced dictionary is <a href="">Wiktionary</a>,
which is remarkably good, even for etymology.
My favorite commercial dictionary is <a href="https://ahdictionary.com/">The American Heritage® Dictionary of the English Language</a>.
The DICT Development Group offers a free <a href="http://www.dict.org/">online dictionary</a> that provides a fast, convenient
interface to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_International_Dictionary_of_English">Collaborative International Dictionary of English</a>.
In addition,
you can submit a query for "yourword" directly as
<code>http://www.dict.org/bin/Dict?Form=Dict1&amp;Query=yourword&amp;Strategy=*&amp;Database=*</code>.
Windows users can download for free the <a href="http://www.freelang.net/dictionary/">Freelang</a> translation dictionaries.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.aiksaurus.com/">Aiksaurus</a> is a powerful, free, cross-platform thesaurus.
Windows users can download <a href="http://wordweb.info/free/">WordWeb</a> for free.
</p>


<h3>Stream Editors</h3>

<p>
The only stream editor I have experience with is <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/sed/">sed</a>,
which is very fast, powerful, and cross platform. (License: GPL)
For an introductory tutorial,
try <a href="http://www.urc.bl.ac.yu/manuals/progunix/sed.txt">SED: A Non-interactive Text Editor</a>.
If you decide to use sed a lot,
you may wish to try <a href="https://github.com/aureliojargas/sedsed">sedsed</a>,
and Python-based sed debugger.
</p>




<h2 id="typemath">Producing Scientific Documents</h2>

<h3 id="docbasics">Basic Considerations</h3>

<p>
Scientific documents will generally include typeset mathematics.
Proper typesetting aids communication,
and ISO31/XI therefore provides typesetting standards.
(See <a href="http://www.tug.org/TUGboat/Articles/tb18-1/tb54becc.pdf">Claudio Beccari's discussion</a>,
but also the <a href="http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/14821/whats-the-proper-way-to-typeset-a-differential-operator">thread on StackExchange</a>.)
</p>

<div>
There are three basic approaches to producing mathematical documents.
<ol>
<li>
WYSIWYG: What you see is what you get.
Generally this means you will use a <a href="#wordprocessor">word processor</a> that provides support for mathematics.
Your printed document will look very similar to the document view in your working environment.
(Which often means it is not typeset very well.)
</li>
<li>
WYSIWYM: What you see is what you mean.  
Generally this means that your working environment will be a user-friendly graphical interface to an underlying typesetting language.
Your printed document will look somewhat similar to the document view in your working environment,
but substantial formatting will be added to the document when it is typeset.
</li>
<li>
WYSIYM: What you see is your markup.
Generally this means that your working environment will be your favorite text editor,
and you will create a plain text document that incorporates markup commands to induce formatting and the typesetting of special symbols.
Your printed document will look quite different from the document view in your working environment.
Substantial formatting will be added to the document when it is typeset,
and your markup commands will not be visible in the typeset document.
</li>
</ol> 
</div>

<h4>WYSIWYG</h4>

<p>
A good cross platform solution is <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/">Open Office</a>,
which includes the oomath formula editor.
<a href="http://www.openoffice.org/">Open Office</a> is free and open source software.
</p>

<p> 
Another cross platform solution is <a href="#abiword">AbiWord</a>,
which brilliantly uses MathML as its internal representation of mathematics.
AbiMath can import MathML equations.
AbiWord also support <a href="#itex">itex</a> for equation input,
which is quite wonderful.
</p>

<p>
For Windows users,
the most common approach is Microsoft Word with embedded <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/murrays/2018/09/30/officemath/">OfficeMath</a> equations.
Unfortunately for old documents,
<a href="https://support.office.com/en-us/article/equation-editor-6eac7d71-3c74-437b-80d3-c7dea24fdf3f">new versions of Word no longer support Equation Editor 3 or earlier</a>.
Unfortunately, many journals do not allow embedded equations in submitted articles.
This is a rather clumsy environment if your writing includes much mathematics,
but it is widely used.
</p>


<h4 id="wysiwym">WYSIWYM</h4>

<p>
Some working environments allow you to see your mathematics in a form closely related to how it will be printed,
while reserving polished document formatting to a separate "typesetting" process.
Anyone who has printed a web page is familiar with the difference between the screen display and the typeset printed version (or "print preview") of the document:
just imagine directly editing such a screen display before typesetting your document.
These are sometimes called WYSIWYM (what you see is what you mean) environments.
</p>

<div id='latexgui'>
<p>
The most popular WYSIWYM environments are interfaces to an underlying <a href="#TEX">LaTeX</a> document.
In such an environment,
you will see for example the glyph <code>&beta;</code> instead of the LaTeX code <code>\beta</code>.
</p>

<p id="LyX">
The only cross-platform implementation I know of is <a href="http://www.lyx.org">LyX</a>.
Binaries are available for Linux, Mac, and Windows users.
LyX can interface with the <a href="#Maxima">Maxima</a> computer algebra system.
(Just add the path to Maxima in Tools -&gt; Preferences -&gt; Paths.)
</p>

<p>
An interesting alternative is <a href="http://www.texmacs.org/index.php3">TeXmacs</a>.
</p>

<p>
Windows users appear to have a number of commercial choices,
the most popular of which seems to be <a href="http://www.mackichan.com/">Scientific Notebook</a> and <a href="http://www.mackichan.com/">Scientific Word</a>.
(Scientific Notebook is not marketed as a LaTeX front end,
but as of 2004 it still saves in LaTeX format and with a tiny amount of editing can be used that way.)
See <a href="#sw-hints">Scientific Word user hints</a>.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.wolfram.com/">Mathematica</a> notebooks can also be used as an WYSIWYM interface for mathematical documents,
with some support for both LaTeX and MathML export.
</p>
</div>


<p id='mathmlgui'>
In the WYSIWYM world,
MathML is an obvious alternative to the LaTeX as an underlying document format.
(In principle,
this should not matter much to a user,
who should be able to work in the GUI environment and not worry much about the underlying format.)
The <a href="http://www.w3.org/Amaya/">Amaya browser/authoring tool</a> enables the WYSIWYM production of mathematical documents,
uses MathML as the underlying format.
Unfortunately, I find Amaya slow and clumsy for the production of mathematics,
and development has stopped.
</p>


<h4 id="wysiym">WYSIYM</h4>

<p>
The most powerful way to produce mathematics is to learn a markup language for type-setting mathematics.
In this case, what you see is your markup (WYSIYM).
This also provides a big advantage for the process of writing:
you get to use your favorite <a href="#EDITORS">text editor</a> and thereby get access to powerful editing facilities.
The most popular choice is <a href="#TEX">LaTeX</a>,
which is almost the universal WYSIYM choice among mathematicians, physicists, and economists.
It is also my personal choice.
An alternative is <a href="http://lout.sourceforge.net/">Lout</a>,
which is much less widely used but has some strong advocates.
A full Lout installation is remarkably small:
the download is less than 2Mb.
The math in a Lout source document looks a lot like math in the <a href="http://wolfram.schneider.org/bsd/7thEdManVol2/eqn/eqn.html">EQN</a> language.
(Speaking of which, some people insist that EQN and <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/groff/groff.html">GROFF</a> remain the right way to typeset mathematics.)
</p>

<p>
If you compile your LaTeX documents with LuaLaTeX,
you can use the <tt>unicode-math</tt> package.
This allows you to enter math as UTF-8 characters,
in addition to using the usual LaTeX codes.
This produces much more readable documents,
but only a few fonts
have substantial support for the Unicode math characters.
(The <a href="https://ctan.org/pkg/unicode-math">unicode-math documentation</a> includes a list of fonts,
including
<a href="https://ctan.org/pkg/tex-gyre-math-pagella">TeX Gyre Pagelle Math</a>
and <a href="https://ctan.org/pkg/asana-math">Asana Math</a>.)
</p>


<h3 id="metafmt">Meta Formats</h3>

<p>
There are a number of efforts to provide a meta-format from which
both LaTeX and XHTML/MathML documents can be generated.
The most notable and currently developed is probably <a href="http://www.albany.edu/~hammond/gellmu/">GELLMU</a>,
although <a href="http://tbookdtd.sourceforge.net/">tbook</a> is also interesting.
I like the much simpler <a href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html">restructured text (reST)</a>,
which allows inline and display math in LaTeX format.
(See my <a href="#reST_hints">reST hints</a>.)
Citation handling is currently (2005) weak,
but <a href="http://code.google.com/p/bibstuff/">bibstuff</a> provides some basic capabilities.
Math support is improving.
It may also be worth trying reST plus Mozilla's itex for web math.
<!-- add link to my document -->
Other metaformat options include:
<a href="http://www.maplefish.com/todd/aft.html">Almost Free Text (AFT)</a>,
<a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">MarkDown</a>,
<a href="http://hobix.com/textile/">TextTile</a>,
and
<a href="http://www.valdemar.net/~erik/setext/">setext</a>.
</p>

<h4>reStructuredText</h4>

<p>
reST to HTML:
just use the rst2html writer.
If you have included math in the document,
use the rst2mathml writer.
</p>

<h5>reST to PDF</h5>

<p>
The usual way of creating PDF from an reST document is the following:
use the rst2latex writer
(or the <a href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/sandbox/jensj/latex_math/tools/rst2latexmath.py">rst2latexmath</a> writer)
to convert the document to LaTeX format,
and then use pdftex to produce the PDF.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/rst2pdf/">rst2pdf</a>
produces PDF directly using the <a href="#reportlab">ReportLab</a> library. 
Good math handling via Matplotlib's mathtext!
</p>

<p>
You can also produce HTML with rst2html and then convert it.
Using Adobe Acrobat can work moderately well,
either by printing from a browser or by directly importing the HTML document.
Alternatively, you can use the <a href="http://www.htmltopdf.org/">xhtml2pdf</a> converter (License: GPL or commercial)
or the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_XML">Prince</a> XML converter.
</p>


<h3 id="TEX">LaTeX and Related Software</h3>

<p>
Background:
LaTeX is a document formatting package based on TeX.
TeX is typesetting software, arguably the best in the world
(especially for mathematics).
In this section I will concentrate on LaTeX and related resources.
</p>

<p>
To get started with LaTeX you will need two things:
a <a href="#EDITORS">text editor</a> or <a href="#latex_ide">IDE</a>,
and a <a href="#texdistro">LaTeX distribution (such as MikTeX, OzTeX, teTeX, or fptex)</a>.
Amazingly enough, you can get everything you need for free.
You can also get great help from other users,
e.g. on <a href="news://comp.text.tex">comp.text.tex</a> or
<a href="http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/miktex-users">the MikTeX users list</a>.
</p>


<p class="boxed">
AU Students:
<br />
For mathematical documents and for long documents (like dissertations!) you should use the LaTeX document preparation system.
There is an <a href="http://www1.american.edu/cas/econ/misc/austyl/authesis.htm">AU Thesis Class</a>,
which automatically handles all the formatting of your dissertation or thesis.
Instructions for using this with Scientific Word are included.
Also see MacKichan Software's <a href="http://www.mackichan.com/techtalk/v30/AddingLaTeXStyle.htm">basic instructions</a> and
<a href="http://www.mackichan.com/techtalk/v30/addinglatexstyle-closerlook.htm">detailed instructions</a>.
You can also <a href="http://stefaanlippens.net/customLaTeXclassesinLyX">use this custom document class</a>
with <a href="#lyx">LyX</a>.
That said,
my recommendation is to us <a href="#vim">Vim</a> with my <a href="http://econpy.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/text/vimfiles/ai_texmenus.vim">MiKTeX menus</a>,
or with <a href="http://vim-latex.sourceforge.net/">Vim-LaTeX</a>.
</p>


<p>
If you are used to word processors,
you may initially find the process of creating a LaTeX document a bit clumsy:
you do not see the document formatting as you write.
However for long documents this is actually an <em>advantage</em>,
which you will grow to appreciate.
You will create your LaTeX input file with your text editor.
In addition to your text,
you will add certain LaTeX formatting commands to this input file.
You will then use your LaTeX distribution to process this input file,
which will produce a device independent (<code>.dvi</code>) file that you can view and print.
Details follow.
</p>

<p>
One caveat:
<br />
while you are working on an academic article,
LaTeX is an excellent environment.
But when submission time comes,
you may pick a journal that does not accept LaTeX.
What to do?
i. Article format generally does not matter until acceptance:
hardcopy submissions are still usually expected, 
and otherwise <acronym class="help" title="Portable Document Format">PDF</acronym> is generally acceptable.
So there is really no problem until an article is <em>accepted</em> at such a journal.
ii. Most journals that express a preference either ask for standard LaTeX or ask for common word-processor formats, but even in the latter case LaTeX is usually acceptable.
iii. If you have written an article in LaTeX and it has been accepted by a journal that for some reason will not accept LaTeX,
you can easily <a href="#texconvert">convert</a> your article to a different format.

<a href="http://miktex.org/unx/">MiKTeX tools</a> have been released for UN*X systems.
</p>

<h3 id="texdistro">TeX Distributions</h3>

<div>
There are many commercial and freeware LaTeX distributions for all platforms.
Each comes with its own installation instructions,
which you must be sure to follow <em>step-by-step</em>.
For Windows 2000 and XP,
I have had wonderful experiences with the freeware <a href="http://www.miktex.org/">MikTeX</a>,
which has managed to make installation a virtually painless 15 minute process
<em>if</em> you read the readme and the prompts.
<p class="wrapcode">
MikTeX is currently the most widely used LaTeX distribution on the AU campus.
We are usually behind  a version or two.
</p>
<a href="http://www.tug.org/texlive/">TeX Live</a> provides a comprehensive TeX system for most systems.
<a href="http://www.cemi.rssi.ru/cyrtug/BaKoMa.TeX/index.html">BaKoMa TeX</a> is an inexpensive distribution for Win95 that got some good press,
and it includes <a href="http://www.dante.de/CTAN/fonts/cm/ps-type1/bakoma/">PostScript versions of the Computer modern fonts</a>. (A very nice feature.)
You can purchase a TeX system (with a lot of other useful stuff) from NTG as <a href="http://4tex.ntg.nl/">4allTeX</a>.
<br />
Mac OSX users: use the <a href="http://ii2.sourceforge.net/tex-index.html">i-Installer</a>!
You can also look at <a href="http://www.rna.nl/">Gerben Wierda's</a> 
<a href="http://www.rna.nl/tex.html">teTeX port to OS X</a> 
comes with an i-Installer installation program and gets great reviews.

<h3 id="learntex">Learning TeX</h3>

<p>
Novices can get acquainted with LaTeX by looking at <a href="http://www.sci.usq.edu.au/staff/robertsa/LaTeX/">a tutorial</a>.
Once you are using some version of LaTeX,
you are likely to find <em>LaTeX: A Document Preparation System</em>
by L. Lamport to be indispensable.
There are many other good books on TeX and LaTeX.
The free <a id="lshort" href="misc/lshort2e.pdf">lshort2e.pdf</a> has most of what a novice will need.
(Check for the <a href="http://metalab.unc.edu/pub/packages/TeX/info/lshort/english/">most recent version</a>.)
More detail can be found in <a href="http://makingtexwork.sourceforge.net/mtw/">Making TeX Work</a>
and many other excellent books.
If you need to write your own class (and you probably do not!) try <a href="https://ctan.org/pkg/clsguide">clsguide.pdf</a>.
</p>

<p>
Users with questions should check
the <a href="http://www.cogs.susx.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html">LaTeX FAQ</a>,
and the <a href="http://tug.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/">LaTeX homepage</a>.

<h4>From LaTeX</h4>

<p>
Extensive conversion capabilities may be provided by <a href="http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc">pandoc</a>.
(Language: Haskell; License: GPL)
See <a href="https://waterprogramming.wordpress.com/2018/08/26/converting-latex-to-ms-word-docx-almost-perfectly/">this blog</a>

If you use LyX,
there is a
<a href="http://wiki.lyx.org/Tools/LyX2OpenOffice">LyX (via LaTeX) to OpenOffice</a> format converter.
(See the same URL for a Mac front end.)
</p>

<h5>LaTeX to PDF</h5>

<p>
PDF files can be read by anyone with access to a <a href="#pdfviewers">PDF viewer</a>.
I have had excellent results using pdflatex.
But see <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/publ-tips.html">Markus Kuhn's tips</a> on how to use (La)TeX to
effectively produce highest-quality <acronym class="help" title="Portable Document Format">PDF</acronym> files.
</p>


<ul>
<li>
pdflatex:
<br />
Just use it to process your .tex file.
<a href="http://www-hep.colorado.edu/~fperez/lyxport/">LyxPort</a>
can help you convert with pdflatex.
If you are including graphics, be sure to read about <a href="http://www.math.upenn.edu/tex_docs/help/faq/uktug-faq/FAQ273.html">graphics extensions</a>.
Note that pdflatex does <em>not</em> support EPS files.
</li>
<li>
divpdfm:
<br />
Just use it to process your .dvi file.
</li>
<li>
<a href="#print2pdf">Print to PDF.</a>
</li>
</ul>

<h5>LaTeX to HTML</h5>
<p>
Note that a successful translation into HTML or MathML can subsequently be read by any modern word processor.
(Of course it will not look as good as in LaTeX!)
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Ian Hutchinson's <a href="http://hutchinson.belmont.ma.us/tth/">
    TtH translator</a>, which does amazingly well in converting <b>T<sub>E</sub>X</b> math to HTML using the built-in fonts of your computer.
    The <a href="http://hutchinson.belmont.ma.us/tth/tth-noncom/tth_exe.zip">MSDoS executable</a>, which runs from the DOS prompt under Windows, may be used for non-commercial purposes only.
    Hutchinson also offers a <a href="http://hutchinson.belmont.ma.us/tth/mml/"><b>T<sub>E</sub>X</b> to MathML</a> converter, which should soon be very useful (i.e., as soon as more browsers and word processors support MathML).
    </li>
    <li><a href="http://para.inria.fr/~maranget/hevea/">HeVeA</a> converts  <b>T<sub>E</sub>X</b> to HTML 4.0 transitional.
    </li>
    <li>
    Eitan Gurari's <a href="http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/~gurari/TeX4ht/mn.html">tex4ht</a> is supposed to be able to translate LaTeX into MathML.
    Installation is rumored to be difficult unless you carefully follow good directions,
    like <a href="http://facweb.knowlton.ohio-state.edu/pviton/support/tex4ht.html">Philip Viton's directions</a>.
    </li>
    <li>
    Philip A. Viton's WinNT version of Peter Wilson's <a href="http://archadserver.arch.ohio-state.edu/crp/files/index.htm#ltx2x"> ltx2x</a>, for detex'ing and html'ing your documents, with some extensions. 
    </li>
    <li>
    Steve Mayer's  <a href="http://www.mayer.dial.pipex.com/tex.htm">TeX Converter</a> is a Windows front-end for using Hevea, Tth, Tex4ht, and Texify to convert <b>T<sub>E</sub>X</b> files. (A recent upgrade allows Hevea to use multiple Scientific Word style files, excluded files (eg tcilatex.tex), saveable configurations and text/info output.)
    </li>
    <li>
    latex2html:
    <br />
    This is a very popular approach. See
    <a href="http://cbl.leeds.ac.uk/nikos/tex2html/doc/latex2html/latex2html.html">All About LaTeX2HTML</a>
<a href="http://www-hep.colorado.edu/~fperez/lyxport/">LyxPort</a> can help you convert with latex2html.
    </li>
    <li>
    <a href="http://www.ktalk.com/index.html">TexPort</a>:
    <br />
    can apparently port a good bit of LaTeX to WordPerfect or Word, including math, simple tables, and macros.
    </li>
    <li><a href="http://web.ukonline.co.uk/julian.smart/tex2rtf/">tex2rtf</a> converts basic LaTeX to HTML (no math).
    </li>
    <li>
    Version 5+ of Scientific Word (and possibly Scientific Notebook) offer substantial abilities to importing LaTeX and export MathML.
    </li>
</ul>

<div>
You can also go LaTeX to HTML via PDF:
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://pdftohtml.sourceforge.net/">pdftohtml</a>
</li>
<li>
Convert <a href="#latex2word">PDF to Word</a>,
which then can be exported as HTML.
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h5>LaTeX to PostScript</h5>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://tug.ctan.org/tex-archive/systems/msdos/dviware/dvips/">dvips</a>:
<br /> 
possibly the easiest way to produce PostScript from your LaTeX document.
Just use dvips to process your .dvi file.
<a href="http://www-hep.colorado.edu/~fperez/lyxport/">LyxPort</a>
can help you convert with pdflatex.
</li>
<li>
Adobe Acrobat:
<br />
just print your .dvi file to the Distiller.
</li>
<li>
You can also create PostScript (.ps) files by
installing a driver for a PostScript printer,
selecting this printer, and printing to a file.
Windows users may want to try the AdobePS HP Laserjet 5P/5MP driver,
which you can download from the Adobe website.
A document may take as much as 35 M to store the print cycle.
If you have trouble viewing the file with GhostScript,
try removing the first line in your .ps file if it contains a
non-<a href="http://www.jimprice.com/jim-asc.htm">ASCII</a> symbol.
(For some printers, including the HP Laser Jet,
this line just turns on the postscript mode.)
You can also try opeing the file in a UNIX text editor.
If you see a huge line instead of usual .ps text,
then you need a to change Windows linebreaks to UNIX linebreaks.
Good luck.
</li>

<li>
<a href="http://www.cs.wisc.edu/~ghost/">GhostScript and GhostView</a> let you view and print PostScript files.
GhostScript includes ps2pdf, for generating .pdf files.
Be sure to see the <a href="http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=dvips-pdf">relevant FAQ</a>
and a <a href="http://phaseportrait.blogspot.com/2007/06/bounding-boxes-and-eps-to-pdf.html">useful discussion</a>.
(To convert an entire direction at the Windows command line,
you can use: <code>for %i in (*.eps) do epstopdf --gsopt=-dPDFSETTINGS=/prepress %i</code>.
Windows users may be interested in the small, fast <a href="http://www.rops.org/">RoPS</a> interpreter,
which has a free Language Level 1 version.

<h4>To LaTeX</h4>
<ul>
    <li>
    Version 5 of Scientific Word (and possibly Scientific Notebook) offers substantial abilities in importing (and exporting) rich text format (RTF) documents.
    Scientific Word reads many LaTeX files,
    so this offers some format conversion possibilities.
    </li>
    <li>
    <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/rtf2latex2e/">rtf2latex2e</a> translates rich text format (RTF) into LaTeX. Claims to handle text formatting, tables, figures, and equations, and to produce LaTeX files that are quite readable and suitable for editing.
    </li>
    <li>
    <a href="http://www.hj-gym.dk/~hj/writer2latex/">Writer2LaTeX</a> converts Open Office and Star Office documents to LaTeX, including any formulae.
    </li>
    <li>
    Chikrii Softlab's shareware <a href="http://www.word2tex.com/">Word2TeX</a> is an output filter for Word that converts even tables and math. It has some minor bugs that can be fixed by manually editing the TeX output.
    They now offer a TeX2Word conversion as well.
    </li>
    <li>Spreadsheets to LaTeX:
    <br />
    <a href="http://calc2latex.sourceforge.net/">calc2latex</a>
    converts OpenOffice spreadsheets.
    <br />
    <a href="http://www.jam-software.com/freeware/xl2latex.zip">Excel2Latex</a> converts Excel spreadsheets to LaTeX and retains quite a bit of formatting information.
    If you have trouble locating this, you can read a spreadsheet into GAUSS and then use the GAUSS archive's conversion utility.
    </li>
    <li><a href="mailto:techexpl@us.ibm.com">ltx2tcx</a> will process a LaTeX document, examine included files and make use of the associated generated .aux and .bbl files to produce a collection of techexplorer enhanced .tcx files.
    </li>
    <li><a href="http://www.alphaworks.ibm.com/formula/texml">TeXML</a> converts XML to TeX.
    </li>
    <li>
    <a href="http://www.winfield.demon.nl/">AntiWord</a> converts Word to plain text,
    which you can use in your LaTeX documents.
    </li>
</ul>




<h3 id="present">Presentations</h3>

<div>
Most existing presentation applications have serious limitations.
<ul>
<li>
Editing is slow
</li>
<li>
Reformatting is cumbersome.
</li>
<li>
Content revision cannot easily be automated.
</li>
<li>
Math handling is mediocre.
</li>
</ul>
On the other hand, for short one-off bullet-point presentations,
with a few images,
these applications are very easy to use.
(E.g., you can just paste your images into a variety of templates.)
</div>

<div>
Two very interesting notebook-based approaches to presentation building are
Mathematica and <a href="http://jupyter.org/install">JupyterLab</a>.
Mathematica is a powerful commercial symbolic algebra package which
supports interactive presentations using the Wolfram Language.
Mathematica pioneered notebook interfaces, which have since become very popular.
Jupyter is a FOSS notebook web application that can serve as a front-end to
dozens of languages, including Python and Julia.
The <a href="https://github.com/choldgraf/jupyter-book">Jupyter Book</a> project
provides tools to convert a collection of Jupyter notebooks
into publication quality documents.
<br/>
To install JupyterLab with pip (at the command line):
<pre>
pip install jupyterlab
</pre>
To run after installing (at the command line):
<pre>
jupyter lab
</pre>
</div>

<div>
For speed and ease of editing,
it is nice to create presentations with a text editor.
This means implies audio and video content will be
included by explicitly linking to the underlying files.
Some obvious candidates are
<ul>
<li>
reStructuredText with an appropriate slide writer
</li>
<li>
LaTeX with an appropriate document style.
</li>
<li>
combine the previous two suggestions with <a href="http://www.agapow.net/programming/python/rst2beamer">rst2beamer</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://member.wide.ad.jp/wg/mgp/">MagicPoint</a> (X11-based, BSD license)
Nice, but development seems to have stopped.
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
A fuller discussion of options can be found in
<a href="http://www.miwie.org/presentations/presentations.html">Wiedman on Screen Presentation Tools</a>.
Here are some options using reStructuredText.
</p>
<pre>
- rst2pdf http://lateral.netmanagers.com.ar/stories/BBS52.html
  (Good math handling via Matplotlib's mathtext!)
- rst2s5 http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/slide-shows.html
  http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/slide-shows.html
  http://www.python.org/doc/slideshows/5min-reST-demo.txt
- Bruce http://pypi.python.org/pypi/bruce
  http://sites.google.com/site/r1chardj0n3s/howto
  (You can embed a Python interpreter in your presentation page!)
- rst2odp http://panela.blog-city.com/rst2odp_on_pypi.htm
- rst2beamer http://www.agapow.net/programming/python/rst2beamer
  http://home.cs.siue.edu/~rkrauss/python_website/
- rst2slidy (cannot find it, but here's Slidy:
  http://www.w3.org/Talks/Tools/Slidy )
</pre>
<p>
Roberto Alesina mentions that if you choose rst2pdf then
fancy transitions are hard,
handouts have to be a separate document,
there is no way to easily center something vertically,
and you need to create different versions for different screen aspect ratios.
(On the other hand,
everything end up in a single file,
your PDF can play almost anywhere,
and you know exactly how it will look.) 
</p>


<p>
If you know LaTeX,
the  <a href="http://latex-beamer.sourceforge.net/">beamer</a> is great,
and you can compile beamer presentation directly with pdftex.
(I found getting started with the <em>beamer</em> document class using MiKTeX's pdflatex to be completely painless.)
Some people prefer
<a href="http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/help/Catalogue/entries/powerdot.html">powerdot</a>
(which supercedes <a href="http://prosper.sourceforge.net/prosper.html">Prosper</a>).
With powerdot you will need to go .tex to .dvi to .ps to .pdf.
(Many integrated TeX environments can automatically implement that sequence for you.)
Some people like the commercial <a href="http://www.utopiatype.com.au/products/ubundle.html">Utopia presentations bundle</a>.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
For presentations, using <acronym class="help" title="Portable Document Format">PDF</acronym> files
(with Acrobat Reader or even GhostView or xpdf)
as the viewer is superior to relying on your dvi previewer.
You can produce <acronym class="help" title="Portable Document Format">PDF</acronym> slides with <a href="http://tug.ctan.org/cgi-bin/CTANcataloguesearch.pl?CATSTRING=pdftex">pdflatex</a> or dvipdfm.
A decent, very simple approach is to use the landscape option for the slides class 
(or better yet use the <a href="http://prosper.sourceforge.net/prosper.html">Prosper</a> class)
and then make sure the <acronym class="help" title="Portable Document Format">PDF</acronym> files know about the page size.
One normally passes such information through the .dvi via
\special commands.
Dvipdfm understands only \special commands that start with "pdf:".
The documentation of dvipdfm gives the following example for landscape pages (letter size paper):
<br /> 
\special{pdf: pagesize width 11.0truein height 8.5truein}
<br /> 
More generically (with the landscape documentclass option):
\special{pdf: pagesize width \the\paperwidth\space height \the\paperheight}
<br />
In pdf{la)tex there are several commands (all starting \pdf...)
that function similar to \special. For example
<pre>
  \setlength{\pdfpagewidth}{11in}
  \setlength{\pdfpageheight}{8.5in}
</pre>
should give you a landscape slide (on screen) in pdflatex. You may
need to specify in AcroRead's print dialog you want the page
rotated to print properly.
<br /> 
See <a href="http://www.math.uakron.edu/~dpstory/pdf_demos.html">David Story's discussion</a>, which I rely on here.
Once you have developed your slides, you can use either the freeware <a href="http://tug.ctan.org/cgi-bin/CTANcataloguesearch.pl?CATSTRING=ppower">PPower4</a> (a pdf post processor written in Java) or <a href="http://ls1-www.cs.uni-dortmund.de/~lehmke/TeXPower">texpower</a>, which can be used to create dynamic effects and works well with pdfslide, pdfscreen, and other slide design classes and packages.
<br />
Btw, if you are using both latex and pdflatex, then
you probably want to omit your .eps and .png file extensions and add a \DeclareGraphicsExtensions command to limit the possible extensions to these (otherwise latex may try too
many extension, wasting time and pool space).
The grfguide and epslatex.pdf cover the \DeclareGraphicsExtensions command.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
There are a few open source presentation programs that are not LaTeX based.
They are more like using PowerPoint.
<a href="http://www.openoffice.org/">OpenOffice</a> includes a presentation program.
GNOME Office includes <a href="http://www.gnome.org/projects/agnubis/">Agnubis</a>,
but it is still work in progress.
</p>

<p id="reportlab">
Another simple but powerful possibility.
The <a href="http://www.reportlab.org/index.html">ReportLab Toolkit</a> includes <a href="http://www.reportlab.org/python_point.html">PythonPoint</a> for presentation creation.
It is amazingly powerful, but a bit complex.
To make things much easier,
you can very simply <a href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/sandbox/richard/pythonpoint/">generate PythonPoint documents</a> from 
<a href="#rest">restructured text (reST)</a>.
Once you have the software installed,
this is about as easy as it can get!
</p>

<h4>Presentations via RestructuredText</h4>

<div>
You can produce very nice presentations using <a href="#rest">reStructuredText</a> with one of it presentation oriented writers.
<ul>
<li> 
S5 or <a href="http://www.netzgesta.de/S5/">S5 Reloaded</a>. (License: GPL)
</li>
<li> 
<a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/bruce">Bruce</a> is a very interesting presentation option.
It supports images and video, and even interactive Python sessions.
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
<a href="http://www.masterviews.com/2004/11/21/xhtml_to_powerpoint_browserbased_css.htm">S5</a> [<a href="http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/">2</a>] can simply create beautiful browser based presentations.
Instead of editing HTML you can use <a href="#rest">reST</a> and convert the text file 
to a slide show with <a href="http://homepage.hispeed.ch/py430/python/index.html#rst2s5">rst2s5</a>.
Also see <a href="http://www.netzgesta.de/S5/">S5 Reloaded</a> and <a href="http://www.robertnyman.com/ajax-s/">AJAX-S</a>.
</p>

<p>
Falling short of a presentation package but still potentially useful
for report writing is <a href="http://gael-varoquaux.info/computers/pyreport/">PyReport</a>,
which compiles a Python script and its (textual and graphical) output into a PDF file.
</p>

<p>
Last but not least:
for incredible animated presentations,
the technically inclined may consider <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/~nspring/slithy.html">Slithy</a>.
</p>

<h4>Dynamic Annotation</h4>

<p>
Often it is helpful to be able to annotate a page during presentation.
Windows users can use <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/zoomit">Zoomit</a>.
(Proprietary but free.)
</p>


<h3 id="textables">Tables</h3>

<p>
One place where a good GUI is nice is for the visual formatting of tables.
Here a nice GUI can provide a real advantage over markup.
This need not mean abadoning LaTeX.
</p>

<p>
<a href="#latexgui">LyX</a> supports <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NF8euiehYjo">table editing</a>.
(You can also <a href="http://wiki.lyx.org/Tips/CopyTablesFromSpreadsheets">copy table data from spreadsheets</a> to LyX.)
</p>

<p>
(Commercial options include <a href="http://www.mackichan.com">Scientific Notebook</a> and possibly <a href="http://www.g32.org/latable/">LaTable</a>.)
When the structure and content of the tables is the dominant consideration, however,
LaTeX tables can often be easily and automatically generated.
For example,
many econometric packages will produce LaTeX formatted tables of results.
</p>

<p>
If your chosen econometric package does not support LaTeX table generation,
you still have a variety of options.
</p>
<ul>
<li> 
<a href="http://brouits.free.fr/csv2latex/">csv2latex</a> is a C program that converts CSV files to LaTeX tables.
(Open office users may wish to combine this with <a href="http://www.molspaces.com/d_misc1.php">calc2latex</a>.
</li>
<li> 
<a href="http://www.american.edu/academic.depts/cas/econ/gaussres/utilitys/latex.src">wrilatex</a>
writes a GAUSS matrix or string array to a LaTeX table.
</li>
<li> 
<a href="http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/loadFile.do?objectType=file">matrix2latex</a>
writes a MATLAB matrix to a LaTeX table.  
</li>
<li> 
<a href="http://econ.ucsd.edu/muendler/docs/stata/est2tex.html">est2tex</a> for Stata.
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.jam-software.com/freeware/xl2latex.zip">Excel2Latex</a> converts Excel spreadsheets to LaTeX and retains quite a bit of formatting information.
<a href="http://www.hha.dk/~skj/Xl2latex.xls">xl2latex</a> performs a similar function.
If you have trouble locating these,
you can read a spreadsheet into GAUSS and then use the GAUSS archive's wrilatex conversion utility.
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="metalatex">Meta Formats for LaTeX</h3>

<ul>
<li> 
Berthold Höllmann's <a href="http://starship.python.net/crew/bhoel/">LaTeX.py</a>
lets you "write your LATEX code in python strings, generate the LATEX output file, and process it by latex and dvips."
Lots of power with a minimum of fuss.
</li>
<li id="rest">
<a href="#metafmt">reStructuredText</a> has some useful <a href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/tools/editors/README.html">editor support</a>.

</ul>


<h4>Compiling TeX</h4>

<ul>

<li>
Using
<a href="#scons">SCons</a> for TeX compilation might be a good idea, or it might be overkill.
In the latter case, consider <a href="http://www.pps.jussieu.fr/~beffara/soft/rubber/">Rubber</a>,
a more modest replacement for makefiles in a TeX environment. (Language: Python.)

<h2 id="matrixlanguages">Scientific Programming Languages</h2>

<p>
Most scientific programming is done in very high level languages.
Two factors to consider in making a language choice are
what software in your area is already written in the language,
and how much original coding you plan to do.
</p>


<h3>Julia for Scientific Programming</h3>

<p>
<a href="https://julialang.org/downloads/">Julia</a>
is probably the right choice for those
looking for an alternative to Python and R.
</p>


<h3 id="numpy">Python + NumPy + Matplotlib + SciPy</h3>

<p>
A key reason <a href="http://www.stat.washington.edu/~hoytak/_static/papers/why-python.pdf">why Python rocks for research</a>
is the NumPy array multi-dimensional library (License: BSD).
NumPy is a very high quality library,
and it has become my favorite approach to matrix (and multi-dimesional array) programming.
This <a href="#python">Python</a> package is written as a C extension,
so it is very fast.
This means you can have full access to the ease of use and to the object-oriented power of the <a href="#python">Python</a> programming language
while doing serious scientific programming.
</p>

<p>
Additionally, an extensive scientific computing environment is provided by <a href="http://www.scipy.org/">SciPy</a>. (License: BSD; Dependency: NumPy.)
For publication quality graphics,
add the excellent graphics package <a href="#matplotlib">Matplotlib</a>.
(License: BSD; Dependency: NumPy.)
</p>

<p>
Most Python users will be best served by a Python distribution
that packages together everything they need as a single install.
For example: NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib (as well as much more) are included in the following distributions.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/">Canopy</a> from Enthought
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://continuum.io/">Anaconda</a> from Continuum
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://winpython.sourceforge.net/">WinPython</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://python-xy.github.io/">Python(x,y)</a>
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.pyzo.org/">Pyzo</a>
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Many scientific programming applications can be found on the <a href="http://www.scipy.org/wikis/topical_software/TopicalSoftware">SciPy Topical Software Wiki</a>.
<a href="http://dirac.cnrs-orleans.fr/ScientificPython/">ScientificPython</a> offers some useful scientific and visualization modules.
The are also some additional <a href="http://probstat.sourceforge.net/">probability and statistics utilities</a> available.
<a href="http://www.ime.usp.br/~pjssilva/pycoin/index.html">Pycoin</a> provides a Python interface to some of the <a href="http://www.coin-or.org/">COIN</a> operations research packages.
Additional functionality can be obtained from the <a href="http://www.cdc.noaa.gov/people/jeffrey.s.whitaker/python/nagpy/">NAGpy</a> interface to the NAG Fortran library
or the <a href="http://py-ml.sourceforge.net/">PY-ML</a> interface to Mathematica.
Python also has modules for interacting with <a href="#gnuplot">gnuplot</a> and <a href="#Rproject">R</a>.
You may also want to see the <a href="http://py.vaults.ca/parnassus/apyllo.py/684222876">Python math tools at the Vaults of Parnassus</a>.
If you need to build GUIs as part of your Python project,
consider the <a href="http://boa-constructor.sourceforge.net/">Boa Constructor</a>.
Additional Python stuff you might find useful for scientific computing:
<a href="http://paida.sourceforge.net/">PAIDA</a> (a Python implementation of the <a href="http://aida.freehep.org/index.thtml">AIDA</a> abstract interface for data analysis),
and the resources listed at <a href="http://www.astro.cornell.edu/staff/loredo/statpy/">StatPy</a>,
and possibly various <a href="http://yaroslav.hopto.org/pubwiki/index.php/ai-python">AI resources</a>.
<a href="http://mdp-toolkit.sourceforge.net/">Modular toolkit for Data Processing (MDP)</a> is a Python data processing library implementing Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Independent Component Analysis (ICA), Slow Feature Analysis (SFA), and Growing Neural Gas (GNG).
Finally, it is worth poking around <a href="http://cheeseshop.python.org/">CheeseShop</a>.
</p>

<p>
Being able to write code in one matrix programming language and run it in another environment can be useful.
Examples include 
Treiber's <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pym/">pym</a> Python program for converting MATLAB to Python,
Cameron Rookley's
<a href="http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/newsreader/view_thread/31512">gtoml</a>

<h3>Java for Scientific Programming</h3>

<p>
Java does not seem to have any eqivalent of Python’s <a href="#scipy">SciPy</a> package for scientific programming.
Pieces of the functionality can be obtained as follows.
(But stick with SciPy if you can.)

<h3 id="other-mpl-free">Support for Matrix Programming in Other Languages</h3>

<p>
I mention only a couple important items from the endless possibilities.
</p>

<div>
Java:
<br />
<a href="https://github.com/mikera/vectorz">VectorZ</a> provides fast double-precision vector and matrix math
and supports n-dimensional arrays.
<br />
<a href="https://sites.google.com/site/piotrwendykier/software/parallelcolt">Parallel Colt</a>
provides support for dense and sparse linear algebra.
This is a dependency of <a href="http://incanter.org/">Incanter</a>,
which provides statistical data processing and visualization functionality.
<br />
<a href="http://nd4j.org/">ND4J</a> is a library for scientific computing on the JVM. (License: Apache 2.0)
A very promising project, but (as of 2015) it is far from mature.
</div>

<div>
C:
<br />
<a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~flame/web/">FLAME</a> is a high-performance dense linear algebra library.
</div>

<h3 id="other-mpl-com">Commercial Options</h3>

<p>
Popular commercial options include Mathematica, MATLAB, <a href="https://www.aptech.com/">GAUSS</a>, and IDL.
For econometrics, the biggest collections of extant code are in MATLAB and GAUSS,
although Python and Julia code have perhaps caught up.
Of these two, Gauss has the advantage of real array broadcasting,
while MATLAB relies on the relatively clumsy <code>repmat</code> and <code>bsxfun</code> for broadcasting.
Recent versions of Matlab supports classes and GAUSS has structs,
but neither language is truly object oriented,
and both often copy array data when it is unnecessary (instead of referencing it).
If you are going to write a lot of your own code,
avoding needless copies can be critical.
You can get this very nicely with the <a href="#numpy">NumPy Python library</a>.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.rsinc.com/">Interactive Data Language (IDL)</a> is popular among astronomers and others doing intensive image processing.
You can run most IDL programs using the <a href="http://gnudatalanguage.sourceforge.net/">GNU Data Language (GDL)</a>.
You can convert your IDL programs to Python with <a href="http://software.pseudogreen.org/i2py/">i2py</a>.
</p>

<p>
If you are forced to work in Matlab you can still have access to Python via
<a href="http://github.com/kw/pymex">pymex</a>,
which "embeds a Python interpreter into Matlab".
</p>

<h4 id="GAUSS">GAUSS and Related Resources</h4>

<p>
See <a href="#gauss-hints">GAUSS user hints.</a>
</p>

<p>
Among matrix-oriented programming languages,
<a href="http://www.aptech.com/">GAUSS</a> was once the first choice among U.S. econometricians.
(Python and Julia now appear to be taking over.)
It is known for speed and ease of use.
Its collection of built-in statistical procedures is large but not as extensive as specialty languages such as S-Plus/Gnu-S,
although this can be offset by its speed and by available free and commercial packages
(such as <a href="http://www.econotron.com/gaussx/gaussx.html">GAUSSX</a>).
</p>



<h5 id="gaussstart">Getting Started with GAUSS</h5>

</p>

<h3>Python</h3>

<p id="python">
I use <a href="http://www.python.org">Python</a> whenever possible,
which is almost always.
(The main exception is when execution speed is at an absolute premium in computationally intensive projects.)
Traditionally thought of as a scripting language,
Python has evolved into an extremely powerful very high level general purpose programming language.
It is still useful (indeed, a first choice) for scripting.
Use it to find out why.
In addition, Python has <a href="#scipy">excellent support</a> for scientific computing.
The <a href="http://docs.python.org/">online documentation</a> is excellent.
If you lack programming experience,
try <a href="http://www-uxsup.csx.cam.ac.uk/courses/PythonAB/">Python for the Absolute Beginner</a>
and <a href="http://swaroopch.info/text/Byte_of_Python:Main_Page">Byte of Python</a>

Also, if you prefer video tutorials, Microsoft has assembled
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrxD0HtieHhS8VzuMCfQD4uJ9yne1mE6">a multipart video introduction</a>.
</p>

<p>
One other note:
although it is an interpreted language,
you can <a href="http://effbot.org/zone/python-compile.htm">compile Python</a>.
Interesting <a href="#psmeta">graphics</a> and <a href="#matrixlanguages">numerical</a> libraries have been developed for Python.
</p>

<h4>L3</h4>

<p>
<a href="http://l3lang.sourceforge.net/">L3</a> is a large subset of Python
along with a GUI interface that provides a "worksheet" like environment. (License: BSD.)

<h3>C</h3>

<div id="clang">
For C/C++ see <a href="http://www.research.att.com/~bs/compilers.html">Bjarne Stroustrup's list</a>.
However, I will list a few free C and C++ compilers that are reputed to be quite good.
If you are new to C, see <a href="http://www-ccs.ucsd.edu/c/">Standard C</a> by Plauger and Brodie.
<br />
Btw, if you program in C/C++, you should probably be using the 
<a href="http://cscope.sourceforge.net/">Cscope</a> code browser;
there is a native <a href="http://iamphet.nm.ru/cscope/index.html">Win32 port of Cscope</a>,
which works with Vim's Cscope interface.
<ul>
<li>
There is a <a href="http://www.cygnus.com/misc/gnu-win32/">Windows port</a> of the GNU gcc compiler.
(I assume you can use the GNU debugger via <a href="http://clewn.sourceforge.net/">Clewn</a> with Vim under Windows,
but I haven't tried.)
<a href="http://www.mingw.org/">MinGW</a> is another, possibly better choice.
To get started with MinGW read <a href="http://www.spacejack.org/games/mingw/">Linkovitch's MinGW Starter Guide</a> and some <a href="http://www.mingw.org/docs.shtml">basic documentation</a>.
Windows users may also want to look at <a href="http://www.delorie.com/djgpp/doc/eli-m17n99.html">DJGPP</a>.

offers its excellent Math Kernel Library free for noncommercial use.
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.digitalmars.com/">Digital Mars</a> offers a good, fast compiler.
(Formally Zortech and then Symantec's compiler.)
You need to buy the CD to get the debugger.

</li>
</ul>
There is <a href="http://www.ulib.org/webRoot/Books/Numerical_Recipes/">online access to <em>Numerical Recipes in C</em></a>,
but I have had occasional trouble getting through.

<h3>Other Free Languages</h3>

<h4 id="script">Scripting Languages</h4> 

<p>
For scripting,
the most popular choices currently seem to be <a href="#python">Python</a>,
<a href="http://www.perl.org/">Perl</a>,
and <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/">Ruby</a>.
There have also been some interesting applications of the embeddable <a href="http://www.s-lang.org/">S-Lang</a> interpreter and programmers library.
<a href="http://www.lua.org/">Lua</a> is especially small and portable,
and is used in the up and coming <a href="http://www.luatex.org/">LuaTeX</a> extension of pdfTeX.
(See my <a href="#luatex_hints">LuaTeX hints</a>.)
<br />
It is also worth mention that <a href="http://www.jython.org/">Jython</a> implements Python as Java,
allowing the ease of Python scripting to be combined with the power of Java.
(As a very cool plus,
<a href="#vim">Vim</a> supports scripting with Perl, Python, and Ruby.)

<h4>Languages for Scientific Computing</h4>

<p>
Haskell is worth considering.

The <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/">GNU Compiler Collection (GCC)</a>
includes front ends and libraries for these
(as well as Objective-C, Java, and Ada).
</p>

<p>
Getting started with Java:
<br />
Download the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">Java Development Kit (JDK)</a>,
which includes the Java Runtime Environment (JRE).
On Windows, you install this by running the downloaded executable.
Then download <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a>,
which is an IDE that is popular for Java development.
You “install” Eclipse simply by decompressing it.
(E.g., on Windows, just unzip it.
It does not make any registry changes.)
Eclipse comes with tutorials.

<h3>Visualizing Data</h3>

<p>
Visual analysis of data remains very useful,
and some innovations in this area are recent.
Classic texts include:
<em>The Visual Display of Quantitative Information</em> by <a href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/">Edward Tufte</a> 
and
<em>Visualizing Data</em> by <a href="http://www.stat.purdue.edu/~wsc/">William S. Cleveland</a>.
You can get the <a href="http://www.stat.purdue.edu/~wsc/visualizing.html">data and S scripts for Cleveland's book</a>.
Cleveland (with Becker and Shyu) developed <a href="http://netlib.bell-labs.com/cm/ms/departments/sia/project/trellis/">Trellis Graphics</a>&trade; for data visualization,
which has been implemented for a number of platforms including S-Plus and R.
(The name &ldquo;Trellis&rdquo; is trade-marked, so these are often referred to as lattice plots.)
<br />
Other resources:
<a href="http://www.galaxy.gmu.edu/~dcarr/">Daniel Carr's page</a>.
</p>

<p>
For interactive data visualizations,
you must consider <a href="https://vega.github.io/vega/about/">Vega</a> and Vega-Lite.
These visualization tools implement a grammar of graphics and a grammar of interactivity,
mostly using declarative specifications in JSON. 
Vega-Lite provides a convenient, very high level access to this grammar.
Many languages now support this,
including JavaScript, Python (Altair), Julia (VegaLite.jl), and Haskell (hvega).
Voyager 2 is an interactive data exploration tool built on top of Vega.
Some languages support this,
including JavaScript, Python (Altair), Julia (DataVoyager.jl).

Mathematica justifiably remains the most popular symbolic math program.
It is excellent for both teaching and research.
(See my <a href="#mma-hints">Mathematica hints</a>.)
It has an unfortunate weakness in document production,
where it lacks many facilities needed for professional books and journal articles.
(Noteworthy missing features are footnotes, floating tables and figures, and bibliograph management.) 
Nevertheless, some researchers apparently use it directly for report and document production.
Mathematica is also a bit expensive,
although Mathematica for Students is available for full-time students at a big discount.
<br />
Check out the <a href="http://www.wolfram.com/mathsource/">MathSource</a> code for Mathematica.
Python users can readily interact with Mathematica using <a href="http://library.wolfram.com/infocenter/MathSource/6622/">Pythonika</a>
and the new <a href="https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/externalevaluationsystem/Python.html">external evaluation system</a>.

<h3 id="webmath">Math on the Web</h3>

<p>
There are a number of way to provide access to nicely formatted math on the Web.
The most widely used is to provide PDF documents that contain nicely formatted math.
The best way to produce good looking math in PDF documents is with <a href="#TEX">TeX</a> based software.
Acceptable results can sometimes be achieved by converting
a word processor document with equation editor objects embedded in it.
</p>

<p>
The other major alternative is to somehow produce math in a web page.
The stand for this is MathML,
but as late as 2021,
FireFox and Opera remain the only major browsers with good support.
(Be sure to download the <a href="#STIX">STIX fonts</a>.)
Producing MathML by hand is impractical,
so there has been a search for feasible ways to rely on MathML.
One of the most interesting approaches is to use <a href="#rest">reStructuredText</a>
with the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/rst2html5/">rst2html5</a> writer.
This approach uses <a href="https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/mathematics.html">LaTeX syntax to input mathematics</a>.
<a href="https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/user/config.html#math-output">Possible output formats</a>
include MathML and MathJax.
This is probably the simplest powerful way to put math on the web.
<br />
Another interesting approache is <a href="http://asciimath.org/">ASCIIMathML</a>,
which simply includes LaTeX-like math in a normal HTML file.
(A clever javascript renders the math.)
Mozilla based <a href="#browsers">browsers</a> such as FireFox have excellent native MathML support,
so they work well with ASCIIMathML.
(But you need to <a href="http://web.mit.edu/ist/topics/webpublishing/mathml/fonts-win.html">install the math fonts</a>.
See the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MathML">Wikipedia MathML article</a>
for a summary of support by other browsers.
</p>


<p>
One other alternative is to convert LaTeX documents directly to XHTML+MathML documents.
This can be done with <a href="https://math.nist.gov/~BMiller/LaTeXML/">LaTeXML</a>,
<a href="http://www.cse.ohio-state.edu/~gurari/TeX4ht/mn.html">TeX4ht</a>,
or with the closely related <a href="http://pear.math.pitt.edu/mathzilla/tex4moz.html">TeX4moz</a>.
<a href="http://hutchinson.belmont.ma.us/tth/mml/">TtM</a> looks like a similar effort.
</p>



<h3 id="browsers">Browsers</h3>

<p>
If you want to test your browser for standards compliance,
start with the <a href="http://acid3.acidtests.org/">Acid 3 tests</a>.
You might also want to look at handling of
<a href="http://www.w3.org/Math/testsuite/">MathMl</a>,
<a href="http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/WG/wiki/Test_Suite_Overview">SVG graphics</a>,
or even a very simple <a href="http://tantek.com/XHTML/Test/minimal.html">XHTML</a>.
(Be sure to look at the tests where the document is <a href="http://tantek.com/XHTML/Test/xhtmlwithprolog.xml">served as XML</a>.)
</p>

<p>
I like three browsers:
<a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox">FireFox</a>,
<a href="http://www.opera.com/">Opera</a>,
and <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/">Chrome</a>.
Of these, I give FireFox the nod for being both open source and mature,
but Chrome is also open source and is considered faster.
Microsoft Edge is slowly becoming usable;
it is certainly much more standards compliant than the old Internet Explorer.
Try them all on the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid3#Desktop_browsers">Acid 3 tests</a>.
An interesting "new kid on the block" is <a href="http://uzbl.org/">uzbl</a>,
which emphasizes speedy browsing but is highly extensible.
</p>

<p>

<h3>Ebooks</h3>

<p>
The ePub3 standard introduced <a href="https://docs.mathjax.org/en/v2.7-latest/misc/epub.html">MathML support.</a>
Quite a few ePub readers support <a href="https://docs.mathjax.org/en/v2.7-latest/misc/epub.html">MathJax</a>.
</p>


<h3 id="email">Email</h3>

<p class="boxed">
Request:
<br />
Please follow basic email etiquette [<a href="http://learn.to//edit_messages">1</a>|<a href="http://www.dtcc.edu/cs/rfc1855.html">2</a>],
by quoting selectively and only as necessary to provide context for your reply.
When appropriate <a href="http://www.american.edu/econ/notes/htmlmail.htm">use only ASCII text</a> for your email.
Finally, if you must use Outlook,
do your interlocutors the courtesy of <a href="#tnef">turning off TNEF attachments</a>!
</p>


<p>
Get a decent email client.
Since there are so many good options,
choose an email client that has a multi-platform presence and,
most importantly, lets you use your own editor.
</p>


<p class="boxed">
Suggestion:
<br />
Using your own editor will repay you handsomely, saving time and frustration.
Here are examples of things any good editor will allow you to do simply.
Preprocess your email to compensate for bad practices by the sender,
delete or reformat blocks of text (e.g., a line, a sentence, or a paragraph) without reaching for a mouse,
adjust capitalization (e.g., change caps to lower case or vice versa, or convert to first letter caps),
and quickly insert text from any other file (i.e., read it in, so you do not need to cut and paste).
One could propose that every application in which you need to edit text should include such facilities. 
E.g., there are many email clients with built in editors that have many such facilities.
But then each time you change applications you will have to learn a new editing environment.
Instead, whenver possible, you should use applications that provide support for an external text editor.
By sticking with your preferred editor you do not have to learn a new editing environment and scripting language each time you switch applications.
That of course is the point of modularity.
</p>

<div>
See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_email_clients">Wikipedia's list of email clients</a>
for a sense of what's out there.
I like the free, cross-platform <a href="http://www.washington.edu/pine/">PINE</a>,
which is keyboard oriented, highly configurable, and has a good Windows version.
But (despite occasional instability on Windows) I generally use
<a href="http://www.mozilla.org/projects/thunderbird/">Thunderbird</a>.
Another email client that is now cross-platform is <a href="http://www.claws-mail.org/">Claws Mail</a>.
<strong>Big plus:</strong> unlike most Windows email clients,
Thunderbird,
<a href="http://www.washington.edu/alpine/">Alpine</a> (formerly pc-pine),
and Sylpheed let you use your favorite editor to edit your email.
Thunderbird supports external editors by means of a plug-in.
<p class="boxed">
See the <a href="#emhints">Thunderbird hints</a> and <a href="#emhints">Alpine hints</a> below.
</p>
Another cross platform solution is now <a href="http://www.mutt.org/">The Mutt Email Client</a>&mdash;long popular among Unix users, and <a href="http://www.geocities.com/win32mutt/win32.html">available to Windows users</a>.
(You can also get mutt along with fetchmail, and sSMTP in a <a href="http://unixmail-w32.sourceforge.net/">unix-mail package for Windows</a>,
but you'll have to install <a href="http://activestate.com/Products/ActivePerl/">Perl</a> and <a href="http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/">Cygwin</a>.)
An email client that is not free but gets great reviews is
<a href="https://www.ritlabs.com/en/products/thebat/">The Bat</a>,
and but it seems to not yet support external editors.
Another popular cross-platform email client is <a href="http://www.mulberrymail.com/">Mulberry</a>,
and it is available on many platforms. (License: Apache 2.0)
One last note on email: if you use Vim as your editor,
you might consider using <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/vimail">vimail</a>,
a simple mail reader for Vim.
</div>

<p>
If you are in an environment that forces you to use Outlook,
you can at least write your email with a <a href="http://cubiclevim.sourceforge.net/">decent editor</a>.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://getpopfile.org/">POPFile</a> sorts your email and filters spam.
It is free and cross platform.
</p>




<h3>Document Formats</h3>

<p>
What are some good document formats,
and how can one transform between them?
</p>

<p>
For writing math,
nothing beats <a href="#tex">LaTeX</a>.
However, you can use <a href="#reST">reStructuredText</a>
with writers that support math to produce both LaTeX and XHTML MathML.
</p>

<h4 id="html">HTML</h4>

<p>
Writing HTML is easy: <a href="http://www.american.edu/econ/notes/html.htm">learn the basics</a>.
Conversion to other formats is possible.
Most word processors will read HTML and automatically convert to their own format.
You can also <a href="http://www.tdb.uu.se/~jan/html2ps.html">convert HTML to PostScript</a> (if you have access to Perl).
</p>

<p>
After learning a few HTML basics,
you can learn much more from the materials at the <a href="http://www.w3c.org">World Wide Web Consortium <acronym>W3C</acronym>)</a>.
Most of the time you should be able to use <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml-basic/">XHTML Basic</a>
and
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-CSS1">Cascading Style Sheets (<acronym>CSS</acronym>)</a>.
Here is some <a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/">CSS Background</a>,
and the wonderful <a href="http://www.meyerweb.com/eric/books/css-progref/">chapter 1</a> 
of Cascading Style Sheets 2.0 Programmer's Reference by Eric A. Meyer.
For more information and links, go to the 
<a href="http://www.w3.org/MarkUp/#recommendations">HyperText Markup Language (HTML) Homepage</a>.
Some authors may like to see the <a href="http://woodworm.cs.uml.edu/~rprice/15445/15445.html">ISO standard</a> as well.
</p>

<p>
All modern Word Processors can export their documents as HTML:
unfortunately, they often produce pretty bad HTML.
You can get much better results with some of the HTML editors,
such as the web development suite offered free by <a href="http://www.evrsoft.com/download/">Evrsoft</a>
</p>

<ul>
<li>
The <a href="http://www.chami.com/free/html-kit/">HTML Kit</a> offers syntax coloring and automatic fix up of common markup errors and conversion to XHTML.
It is based around the W3C sample code for
<a href="http://www.w3.org/People/Raggett/tidy">HTML Tidy</a>.
</li>
<li>
There are very good tutorials at <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/">HTML Schools</a>,

<li id="validate">
<b>Validate your code!</b>
Try the <a href="http://validator.w3.org/">W3C HTML Validation Service</a>.
Also, the <a href="http://www.htmlhelp.org/tools/validator/">WDG Validator</a> has fans because i. it validates your HTML pages without requiring a DTD, and it can ``spider'' an entire site (validating up to 100 pages).
You can overpaste the DTD if it isn't the one you want.
You can also check your Cascading Style Sheets using W3C's <a href="http://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/">CSS Validation Service</a> or HTML Help's <a href="http://htmlhelp.org/tools/csscheck/">CSS validator</a>, which will also warns of possible usability problems with your style sheets.

<h4 id="html">XHTML</h4>

<p>
XHTML is a wonderful HTML related markup which provides for most needs when used with CSS.
Unfortunately some browsers do not support it,
unless you serve it as HTML.
(That is the trick used in the present document.)
Some authors <a href="http://www.hixie.ch/advocacy/xhtml">discourage this practice</a>,
but it should work fine, as long as you <a href="#validate">validate</a> your documents.
</p>

<p>XHTML:
<a href="http://wdvl.com/Authoring/Languages/XML/XHTML/">Introduction to XHTML, with eXamples" helpful</a> |
<a href="http://validator.w3.org/check/referer">
XHTML validation</a>.
With XML/XHTML (handled by an XML processor) you will
be able to define your own entities in the doctype declaration. E.g., you could define
&lt;!ENTITY alpha  "&amp;#xxxx;" &gt;
(where xxxx = the numeric reference)  to get around remembering numeric references.
The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/MathML2/appendixa.html#parsing.module">XHTML+MathML</a> document type looks particularly useful,
and it is already used to provide math support in <a href="#rest">reStructuredText</a>.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.w3.org/Math/">Mathematical Markup Language (MathML)</a> is now a wonderful reality.
FireFox and other Mozilla based browsers offer native support.
So does <a href="http://www.icesoft.no/index.html">E-Lite</a>:
ICESoft's lightweight Java web browser offers full, native MathML implementation.
Internet Explorer browsers currently support it only via plug-ins.

It is supported by <a href="#officesuites">OpenOffice</a>
and the closely related <a href="#officesuites">LibreOffice</a>.
There is also a <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/odf-converter">plug-in converter</a> for MS Word (TM).
<br />
By the way, <a href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/">docutils</a> can write directly to ODF:

<h3 id="tnef">Transport Neutral Encoding Format (TNEF)</h3>

<p>
What is that winmail.dat attachment you just got in your email?
It is a proprietary Microsoft format that bundles together multiple attachments
in a way that most email clients cannot unbundle.  How obnoxious!
So, what can you do about it?
</p>

<p>
One possibility:
ask your interlocutor for the simple courtesy of
<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/290809">turning off TNEF attachments</a>!
(Instructions are the bottom of the article.)
</p>

<p>
If you are unfortunate enough to receive a TNEF attachment from someone
who cannot figure out how to configure their email client to send attachments
that everyone can read, you may have to unpack the TNEF attachment yourself.
The only cross platform solutions I know of are
<a href="http://www.freeutils.net/source/jtnef/">JTNEF</a>
and
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/pytnef/">pytnef</a> (License: LGPL).
At this point, <a href="http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi/pytnef">pytnef</a> relies on the
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/tnef/">tnef</a> command-line utility that is I think only available for unices (although it looks like it could be compiled for Windows).
</p>

<h3 id="emscripts">Email Scripts</h3>

<p>
If you need to produce email in a scripting environment,
Python offers all the basics in the smtplib module.
You can even add <a href="http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/Recipe/52243">MIME attachments</a>
with reasonable ease.

Cross platform:
<a href="http://pan.rebelbase.com/">Pan</a> (GPL)
or
<a href="http://slrn.sourceforge.net/">slrn</a>
or
<a href="http://www.gnus.org/">Gnus</a>.

</p>


<h3 id="AV">AntiVirus</h3>

<p>
First let me offer an apparently outrageous suggestion:
individual users can often substitute good habits for AV software,
and even if you install AV software these good habits are crucial defenses.
That said,
whatever software you choose,
you may wish to test it on the <a href="http://www.eicar.org/">EICAR</a> test file.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
The only free and open source AV software that I know of is
the very interesting <a href="http://www.clamav.net/">ClamAV</a>. (License: GPL)
There is a <a href="http://www.clamwin.com/">ClamWin</a> project for Windows users.
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.avast.com/">avast! Home</a> is free for noncommercial use.
And <a href="http://www.grisoft.com/">AVG</a> currently offers a "free edition" that looks reasonably good
and customer satisfaction at AVG seems quite high
(at least in the email forums I frequent).
</li>
<li>Commercial:
There are many: do a web search.
Here are a couple with short comments.
<a href="http://www.f-prot.com/">F-Prot</a> is no longer free but it is cheap.
<a href="http://www.norman.com/">Norman Virus Control</a> is available on many platforms.
<a href="http://www.kaspersky.com/">Kaspersky AV</a> gets good marks for not interfering with other programs.
<a href="http://www.symantec.com">Norton Anti-Virus</a> seems thorough but I have heard reports of conflicts with other programs.
Many people are reporting obnoxious marketing practices at <a href="http://www.mcafee.com/">McAfee Security</a>, including
restricting the set of browsers usable for downloading antivirus updates by using unnecessary and incompatible ActiveX controls,
automatically enrolling new purchasers in a paid update program using the credit card information provided during an initial purchase and at the same time providing no easy way to change this,
and hitting you with pop-up ads every time you visit their site.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
TO AVOID SENDING AND RECEIVING VIRUSES:
<br />
SENDING
<br />
i. use plain text to send and receive
information whenever possible.
All word processors and spread sheets
can save as .txt.
There is seldom a real need for using
anything except plain text for email.
<br />
ii. When plain text is not possible
(because special formatting is required)
you can almost always use HTML.
All modern word processors
and spread sheets can save as HTML.
This is almost risk free, but to be
really safe you can turn off Java and
JavaScript in your browser preferences.
<br />
iii. When page formatting is crucial,
which it almost never is,
use Adobe's <acronym class="help" title="Portable Document Format">PDF</acronym> format.
You may need a PDF "printer driver" to do this
(such as Adobe Acrobat, Jaws, or some <a href="#freepdf">free alternatives</a> such as <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pdfcreator/">PDFCreator</a>).
<br />
RECEIVING:
<br />
i. Many viruses are received as part of email attachments.
Other malware (known as worms) will email
themselves from an infected computer to many others.
So the best practice would be to not open <em>any</em> email attachments.
Unforunately, sometimes we need to open attachments.
ii.  If you must open an attachment, view the file extension.
The default in Windows is to turn off your ability to do this,
which means you can be tricked into thinking a dangerous
Visual Basic script <code>filename.jpg.vbs</code>
is really a safe <code>.jpg</code> file.
You can fix by following <a href="#windows-hints-extensions">this windows hint</a>.
For Windows users,
especially dangerous extensions are <code>.exe</code>, <code>.com</code>, <code>.pif</code>, <code>.vbs</code>.
Also dangerous are <code>.doc</code> and <code>.xls</code>.
(Comment: dangerous file types can be included as ``attachments'' to <code>.pdf</code> files as well,
which means you should not open such attachments with Adobe Acrobat either.)
<br />
iii. When possible, avoid the use of susceptible
proprietary file formats (such as Word or Excel).
Related to this, avoid the use of Outlook unless you know
how to turn off all its dangerous features.
And if you simply <strong>must</strong> open a document
in a MS format (e.g., because that's what
a work colleague sent you), learn how to
turn off the availability of macros.
You should also be cautious with any other
format that supports macros, which basically
means you should avoid exchanging information
in word processor formats (see i. and ii.  above).
<br />
iii. <strong>Never</strong> run a program file unless you
<strong>know</strong> it came from an <strong>impeccable</strong> source.
(For Windows users,
this includes file extenstions .exe, .com, .pif, .bat, and .vbs.)
<br />
iv. Windows users should <strong>disable</strong> autoplay,
since it allows arbitary executable to run automatically on your computer.
</p>
<p>
<b>Additional Comment:</b>
Many new viruses are not detected by anti-virus software.
Safe practices are necessary.
Furthermore, if the recipient wishes to read what you send in their
word processor, all modern word processors also import plain text (very safe),
HTML (pretty safe), and PDF (usually safe) very simply.
</p>







<h3 id="multimedia">Multimedia Resources</h3>

<p>
Since this is not a core interest of mine,
I list only a couple resources.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
The cross-platform <a href="http://pymedia.org/">PyMedia</a> Python module provides an interface for the digital media manipulation
(wav, mp3, ogg, avi, divx, dvd, cdda, etc).
It includes parsing, demutiplexing, multiplexing, coding and decoding.
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.videolan.org/">VideoLAN</a> provides "a highly portable multimedia player for various audio and video formats".
(License: GPL)
VLC is an amazing multiplatform, FOSS resource.
(Includes an installer for Windows users.)

<h3>Modeling Languages and Solvers</h3>

<h4>Modeling Languages</h4>

<p>
The modeling languages most widely used by economists are commercial:
<a href="http://www.gams.com/">GAMS</a>
(with <a href="http://www.gams.com/docs/document.htm">online documenation</a>)
and <a href="http://www.copsmodels.com/gempack.htm">GEMPACK</a>
(with <a href="http://www.copsmodels.com/gpmanual.htm">online documentation</a>).
Economists use these primarily for CGE modeling.
(See these helpful <a href="http://www.ifpri.org/sites/default/files/publications/gamsexer.pdf">CGE exercises</a> with 
<a href="http://www.ifpri.org/publication/key-exercises-cge-modeling-using-gams">solutions</a>.)

<h3>Integrated Development Environments</h3>

<p>
For Python, <a href="http://mmm-experts.com/Products.aspx?ProductId=4">PyScripter</a> has an excellent reputation.
But it has limited support for threading.
(Windows only; license unknown.)
</p>
<p>
For Java,
consider the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a> IDE.
(Eclipse is a "general purpose" IDE.)
Python users can also use Eclipse via the <a href="http://pydev.sourceforge.net/">Pydev</a> plugin.
</p>
<p>
For C and C++,
consider the <a href="http://www.a-a-p.org/index.html">Agide</a> IDE.
You can use Vim as your editor!
On Linux/KDE, you can alternatively use <a href="http://www.kdevelop.org/">KDevelop</a>,
which also support Vim as an editor.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://vimmate.rubyforge.org/">VimMate</a>
is a light GTK-based IDE that embeds the Vim editor.
</p>
<p>
For Python:
<br />
- the general purpose <a href="http://leoeditor.com/">Leo</a> IDE includes a unique and powerful outlining facility (Language: Python; License: MIT)
<br />
- the relatively lightweight <a href="http://eric-ide.python-projects.org/">Eric</a> IDE gets very good reviews.  (Language: Python; License: GPLv3)
<br />
- <a href="https://github.com/davidhalter/jedi-vim">Jedi</a> helps turn VIM into a Python IDE by adding autocomplete.
</p>

<p>
For Android, Google has released <a href="http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html">Android Studio in 2014</a>.
</p>


<h3 id="javascript">JavaScript/ECMAScript/ES</h3>

<p>
ECMAScript is a standaradization of JavaScript,
a dynamic, interpreted programming language whose origins
are in client-side scripting in the browser.
Most browsers support ECMAScript,
and client-side scripting has been used to create economic applications. [#paine.stark-2004-cheer]
These features made it a widely used language.
Growth in language features, including support for functional programming,
have made it a rather interesting language as well.
</p>

<p>
If you are new to JavaScript,
I have written a <a href="https://subversion.american.edu/aisaac/notes/javascript-intro.xhtml">basic introduction</a>.
</p>



<h3 id="java">Java</h3>

<div>
Java is a strongly-typed object-oriented language.
If you want to program in Java,
consider the <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a> IDE.
The <a href="http://www.bluemarsh.com/java/jswat/">JSwat</a> debugger front end may also prove useful.

or simply to <a href="http://www.mannyjuan.com/pythtips.htm">test your scripts</a>.
</p>

<h3>Cross Platform GUI</h3>

<p>
The obvious language independent FOSS choices currently (2005) seem to be TK and wxWindows,
with TK being simpler, more mature, and a bit slower and wxWindows being faster and more powerful but less stable.
Of course Java provides a language dependent solution.
</p>

<h4>Tkinter</h4>

<p>
Python comes with the Tkinter module,
which provides a Python interface to the TK graphical user interface (GUI).
<a href="http://www.3dartist.com/WP/python/tknotes.htm">Tkinter documentation</a> is spread around.
For a very brief introduction,
you can try <a href="http://www.freenetpages.co.uk/hp/alan.gauld/tutor2/tutgui.htm">Alan Gauld's tutorial</a>.
If you use Tkinter,
consider using <a href="http://pmw.sourceforge.net/">Python megawidgits (Pmw)</a>.
(You can also easily add graphing extensions with <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/blt/">BLT Toolkit</a>.
You may want to also get <a href="http://cars9.uchicago.edu/software/python/index.html">Mark Rivers's enhancements</a>.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://tk-happy.sourceforge.net/">tk_happy</a>
allows very fast, menu guided tkinter GUI creation.
</p>

<h4>Curses</h4>

<p>
Until recently curses has been unavailable for Windows.
<a href="http://adamv.com/dev/python/curses/">Wcurses</a> is a curses module for Python that works under Windows.
There may also be some profit in considering <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/interopmigration/unix/sfu/curseapp.mspx">curses applications on INTERIX</a>.
</p>

<h4>wxWindows</h4>

<p>
<a href="http://www.wxwindows.org/">wxWidgets</a> offers cross-platform API (C++ library) for writing GUI applications.
<a href="http://www.wxpython.org/">wxPython</a> is a Python extension module that wraps wxWidgets.
<a href="http://dabodev.com/about">Dabo</a> is a cross-platform application development framework,
written in Python atop the wxPython GUI toolkit.
(Dabo capabilities resemble Visual Basic or Visual FoxPro, but it's cross platform.)

</p>

<h4>Encapsulated PostScript (EPS)</h4>

<p>
Encapsulated PostScript (<acronym class="help" title="Encapsulated PostScript">EPS</acronym>) remains a very important
standard for graphics inclusion in journals and books.
It therefore pays to learn a drawing application or language that allows you to generate encapsulated PostScript
(<acronym class="help" title="Encapsulated PostScript">EPS</acronym>).  
You can convert
<acronym class="help" title="Encapsulated PostScript">EPS</acronym>
to
<acronym class="help" title="Portable Network Graphics">PNG</acronym>
or
<acronym class="help" title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</acronym>.
(See <a href="#convert">below</a>.)
</p>

<h4>Portable Document Format</h4>

<p>
In many applications,
<acronym class="help" title="Encapsulated PostScript">EPS</acronym>)
is being replaced by Adobe's Portable Document Format
(<acronym class="help" title="Portable Document Format">PDF</acronym>).
<acronym class="help" title="Portable Document Format">PDF</acronym>) and page indepdence and support for new features,
but loses the powerful <a href="#postscript">PostScript</a> <a href="#drawlang">drawing language</a>.
</p>

<h4>Portable Network Graphics (PNG)</h4>

<p>
Currently the best choice for web graphics.
(GIF and JPEG suffer patent problems, although these patents are finally expiring.)
Before placing graphics on the Web, visit the <a href="http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/">Portable Network Graphics (PNG) homesite</a>.  
</p>

<p id="MNG">
MNG and APNG
<br />
The animated version of PNG is called
<a href="http://www.libpng.org/pub/mng/">MNG, for Multiple-image Network Graphics</a>.
It supports looping (including nested loops),
clipping, deltas, and other features, plus
everything PNG supports-- including alpha
transparency.
Unfortunately implementations have been lagging.
However FireFox supports the <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/APNG_Specification">animated PNG (APNG)</a> format,
which is less complete but quite capable.
</p>


<h3 id="drawlang">Drawing Languages and Metalanguages</h3>

<p>
With all the point and click drawing applications currently available,
why bother with a drawing language?
The answers are generally <a href="http://www.american.edu/econ/notes/psdraw.pdf">precision, speed, and fun</a>,
often in that order.
This section concentrates on 2-D drawing, with emphasis on the PostScript drawing language,
while mentioning a few other interesting possibilities.
</p>

<p>
The so-called <a href="http://amzn.to/2sHsN2Y">Grammar of Graphics</a>
has garnered attention because of its power and expressiveness.
<a href="https://plotnine.readthedocs.io">PlotNine</a> is an implementation for Python.
<a href="http://ggplot2.org/">ggplot2</a> is an implementation for R.
It is supported by two popular books:
<a href="http://amzn.to/2tbCtzN">R Graphics Cookbook</a>
and
<a href="http://amzn.to/2rEXvoF">ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis</a>.
</p>


<h4 id="postscript">PostScript</h4>

<p>
PostScript is a device independent page description language.
If you want to precisely render a vector graphic,
you may well find it convenient to draw it yourself in PostScript.
I offer an introduction to
<a href="https://subversion.american.edu/aisaac/wp/psdraw.xhtml">PostScript Drawing for the Sciences</a>.

<h4 id="SVG">Scalable Vector Graphics</h4>

<p>
<acronym class="help" title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</acronym>
<br />
This popular format for web graphics can be useful when you need vector graphics and/or animation.
It was supposed to be possible to <a href="http://jan.kollhof.net/projects/svg/svgpdf/index.xhtml">embed SVG in PDF</a>,
and for a while Adboe worked actively on an SVG viewer (which is <a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/svg/adobe-svg-viewer-download-area.html">still available</a>).
This seems to have stalled,
and indeed further development of the SVG standard unfortunately seems to have stalled.
For extensive SVG manipulation and generation tools,
see <a href="http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/batik/">Batik</a> (language: Java).
An increasing number of graphics languages offer an SVG backend.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/">Scalable Vector Graphics</a> is a royalty free vector graphics standard for the Web,
and it is a powerful animation format.
(If you have simple, static graphics to produce, you might write them in PostScript and then translate using <a href="http://www.geocities.com/wglunz/pstoedit/">pstoedit</a>.)
<br />
One of many nice things about SVG is that it can be embedded into PDF,
animations and all!
(See this <a href="http://www.carto.net/papers/svg/us_population/us_population.pdf">very cool example</a>.
Here is a <a href="http://www.kevlindev.com/utilities/">perl script</a>.
Here is a <a href="http://www.tu-harburg.de/parallel/koehnlein/privat/SVGtoPDF.java">Java converter</a>.
Here is a <a href="http://jan.kollhof.net/projects/svg/svgpdf/index.xhtml">Python script</a>.
(If you can find Leonard Rosenthol's Acrobat plug-in, let me know.
It seems to have disappeared.)

<br />
Another nice thing is that you can <a href="http://surguy.net/articles/client-side-svg.xml">move image generation to the client side</a>.

A cross-platform standard for graphics is Encapsulated PostScript (<acronym class="help" title="Encapsulated PostScript">EPS</acronym>).
<acronym class="help" title="Encapsulated PostScript">EPS</acronym>
is sometimes the expected graphics format by publishers
when you submit drawings for a book or journal article,
although PDF is becoming more universal.

<li id="jpeg2eps">
There are a number of good options for converting JPEG files to EPS.
Note that PostScript (level 2+) supports JPEG, so this is largely a matter of adding an appropriate wrapper.
My favorite approach is to use the ability of <a href="#pyx_hints">PyX</a> to <a href="http://pyx.sourceforge.net/examples/bitmap/jpeg.html">insert JPEG images</a> into EPS and PDF files.
A more popular approach is to use <a href="http://www.pdflib.com/">PDFlib</a>'s very fast
<a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20131003144811/http://www.pdflib.com/download/free-software/jpeg2ps/">jpeg2ps</a> converter. (Language: C)
This wraps the JPEG file formats in a PostScript wrapper,
without uncompressing the images.
(PostScript Level 2 and Level 3 interpreters support decompression of JPEG file formats (JFIF but not JPEG2000).)
There is a <a href="http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/jpeg2ps.htm">Windows version</a>.
Lee Sau Dan provides a <a href="http://www.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~danlee/fun/jpeg2eps">perl script that does much the same thing</a>. (Licence: GPL2)
An interesting approach is <a href="http://rses.anu.edu.au/~andy/jpeg2eps/">jpeg2eps</a>,
which is written in PostScript (and therefore requires an interpreter, such as GhostSript, to run);
it wraps JPEG files so that an EPS interpreter can handle them.
The adventurous can try <a href="http://www.tinaja.com/text/jpeg2pdf.html">Don Lancaster's recipe</a>,
which is code to be inserted directly into a PostScript file.
(After a few minutes trying, I did not get this to work, but Lancaster is brilliant so it should.

I often find myself using <a href="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/">Matplotlib</a> for these.
(<a href="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/">Matplotlib</a> is a wonderful 2-D plotting package which also supports powerful interactive graphics.)
PyX and Matplotlib support the generation of EPS and PDF plots with LaTeX text.
(Additionally, Matplotlib provides an impressive <a href="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/matplotlib.mathtext.html">mathtext</a> capability independent of LaTeX.)
</p>

<p>
Matplotlib and Pyx currently take different approaches to math text.
PyX uses LaTeX to typeset the math,
so you must have a working LaTeX installation.
Pyx generates PostScript, PDF, and SVG graphics with this approach.
Matplotlib uses its own parser and layout engine
to typeset math text with Type 1 computer modern fonts.
You do not get the full power of TeX typesetting,
but you can produce outputs in a variety of formats
(including EPS, PNG, and PGF).
Here are <a href="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/matplotlib.mathtext.html">some details</a>.
</p>



<p>
Matplotlib supports spark graphs (sparklines) via the <a href="http://agile.unisonis.com/proj/sparkplot/sparkplot.py">sparkplot</a> module.
(Sparklines can also be produced with PIL using the <a href="http://bitworking.org/projects/sparklines/">Sparkline Generator Web Application</a>.)

<p id="gnuplot">
Before exploring other possibilities,
try <a href="http://gnuplot.sourceforge.net/">gnuplot</a>.
It meets most non-interactive data driven or function driven plotting needs.
It is free and open source, multiplatform, very fast, and very powerful.
(There is a <a href="http://www.lee-phillips.org/info/Macintosh/gnuplot.html">Mac version</a>,
and here are some <a href="http://gamma.magnet.fsu.edu/install/mac/gnuplot/">instructions for installing under OSX</a>.)

<br />
Features: In addition to plotting 2-D and 3-D graphs of arbitrary functions,
gnuplot can also quickly plot large data sets.
It has a powerful yet intuitive scripting language.
GNUPLOT can provide output in many different formats,
including the LaTeX picture environment and <acronym class="help" title="Encapsulated PostScript">EPS</acronym>.
The LaTeX and epslatex output "terminals" allow for math symbols etc.
(After LaTeXing the resulting .tex file, the .dvi file can be converted to PostScript using dvips -o.
The Ghostview previewer can then be used to convert the PostScript file,
fonts and all,
to <acronym class="help" title="Encapsulated PostScript">EPS</acronym>.)
All told this is quite a powerful plotting tool with extremely flexible output.
New users should read <a href="http://www.cs.uni.edu/Help/gnuplot/">Introduction to GnuPlot</a>,

<h3 id="latexgraphics">Graphics for LaTeX</h3>

<p>
If you produce documents in LaTeX, you would naturally
like the fonts and equations in your graphics to match
those in your text.
There are a variety of solutions.
Nowadays the simplest answer by far is to learn to use TikZ.
</p>

<div id="tikz">
See the <a href="#tikz-hints">TikZ hints</a>.
<br />
If your figures are simple (or if you are patient),
use the very powerful TikZ drawing language directly in your LaTeX document.
TikZ does <em>not</em> depend on PostScript,
you can use it directly with pdflatex.
(Conveniently, it is <em>also</em> compatible with the dvips/ps2pdf route.)
Sean Farley offers an <a href="http://siam.lsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/tikz.pdf">useful tutorial</a>.
<br />
There are many TikZ libraries available,
including <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/pgfplots/">pfgplots</a> for drawing plots
and <a href="http://altermundus.com/pages/downloads/index.html">tkz-graph</a> for drawing graphs.
These can greatly simplify your drawing tasks.
<br />
<a href="#gnuplot">gnuplot</a> since version 4.4 has a <a href="http://peter.affenbande.org/gnuplot/">TikZ “terminal”</a>. Very nice!
<br />
<a href="http://tikzedt.org/doc.html">TikzEdt</a> (License: GPL3) and
<a href="http://www.hackenberger.at/blog/ktikz-editor-for-the-tikz-language">KtikZ</a> can nicely help
you create tikz figures.
(Mykel Kochenderfer has compiled a <a href="http://mykel.kochenderfer.com/tikz/">KtikZ Windows binary</a>.)
Related functionality is provided by <a href="https://github.com/jeroenjanssens/tikz2pdf">tikz2pdf</a>.  (License: BSD)
<br />
If your figures are complex but drawable by hand,
you can create them with the <a href="#TpX">TpX</a> drawing application,
which can output tikz code.
(You can set the default output format to tikz <em>before</em> you start your drawing,
or you can change the format in the picture properties.)
Unfortunately, develop on this has stopped.
</div>

<p>
For great results even in complex drawings,
try the <a href="#pyx">PyX</a> graphics package for Python.
This will require an initial investment of experimentation and learning,
but the results (as EPS or PDF) are fabulous.
</p>



<div>
<!-- http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/adonthell-devel/2002-09/msg00006.html -->
Users of PostScript and pdflatex face an annoyance:
pdflatex does not directly support the inclusion of EPS files.
However, according to Kai Stirker, one can include EPS files in pdflatex files as follows.
<ul>
<li>
In your header put: <code>\usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}\usepackage{epstopdf}</code>.
</li>
<li>
Run pdflatex with the <code>--shell-escape</code> command line switch.
</li>
</ul>
Note that you will need to have installed <a href="http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/supported/oberdiek/epstopdf.sty">epstopdf</a>,
which you get when you install GhostScript.
Then just <code>\includegraphics{filename.eps}</code> as usual to include your EPS graphic,
and pdflatex will conver them to pdf format on the fly.
(Be sure to return the extension! Otherwise you will get conversion the first time,
and use of the old PDF after that.)
</div>

<div>
If you want your EPS files to be truly portable, you need to embed the fonts.
If you use a drawing application, make sure it is configured to embed the fonts.
If you convert your .dvi files to PS,
you can tell dvips to embed all fonts with the -Pdownload35 option
<br />dvips -t letter -Pdownload35 file.dvi -o file.ps
<br />
If you are producing PDF files, you can use
<a href="http://www.linuxcommand.org/man_pages/pdffonts1.html">pdffonts</a>
to check for font embedding.
If using ps2pdf  you can use the option <code>-dEmbedAllFonts=true</code>.
See <a href="http://multimedia.polito.it/masala/pub_font_embedding_pdf_linux.html">this document</a>
for more discussion.

Laptop (and cell phone) theft is a constant problem.
The <a href="http://preyproject.com/">Prey Project</a> offers a multiplatform, FOSS theft recovery tool.
It uses Google geo location and a web camera if available,
and is available for the Android operating system.
(A related commercial product is <a href="http://www.orbicule.com/undercover/">Undercover</a> by Orbicule,
which has additional functionality and is very user friendly.)
Here are some other possible steps to take.
You can run <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autossh">autossh</a> as a service that creates a link between your home router and laptop. Then whenever your laptop has internet, you can ssh into it from home.
You can also install a <a href="http://www.keylogger.org/">keylogger</a>
and schedule (e.g., with <a href="http://developer.apple.com/macosx/launchd.html">launchd</a> or cron)
to say sftp the log every day and then restart the log file.
(Personally I would only use open source keyloggers,
such as <a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/pykeylogger">PyKeylogger</a>,
but these tend to be less focused on hiding themselves.)
Probably better than any of this is vigilant use of a laptop cable lock.

<p>
There are lots of good calendars out there.
But if you are "always connected"

(I have not tried to use it offline.)
Note that you can <a href="http://www.downloadsquad.com/2008/01/14/google-calendar-now-available-on-your-firefox-sidebar/">add Google Calendar to your FireFox sidebar</a>.
Comment: if you ever see a corrupted screen when viewing Google Calendar,
try clearing your browser's cache and cookies.
</p>

<p>
Generally it seems a good idea that your calendar support the 
<a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2445.txt">iCalendar standard</a>.
(This means you can easily move it between applications and across platforms.)
It also means you can easily write scripts that interact with your calendar.
For example,
you can use the <a href="http://codespeak.net/icalendar/">iCalendar</a>.
(License: LGPL; Language: Python.)
An alternative is the <a href="http://www.nongnu.org/python-pdi/">Python-PDI</a> library for personal data interchange,
which also handles the vCard format.

</p>


<h4 id="addressbooks">Address Books</h4>

<p>
The address book situation is a scandal.
Applications have not settled on a standard for data sharing
and do not even adequately document their own formats.
The best documented formats,
<a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/Examples_of_various_Address_Book_formats">VCARD and LDIF</a>,
are not great.
For such a widespread need, this is a rather astonishing situation.
</p>

<p>
Thunderbird comes with a pretty good address book tool.
Unfortunately,
it saves address books in Mork (.mab) format,
and if you back these up it cannot import them!
Fortunately, there is a
<a href="http://tarvid.kallimagarden.com/mork/index-parser.html">Mork parser library</a>
(Language: Python)
Thunderbird 3 was supposed to replace the horrible Mork format
with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MozStorage">MozStorage</a>,
thereby adopting the storage format now used in FireFox.
But the <a href="http://kb.mozillazine.org/Moving_address_books_between_profiles">current situation</a> is still bad.
However, there is an <a href="https://freeshell.de//~kaosmos/morecols-en.html">address book extension</a> that improves things.
</p>

<p>
Most PIMs include address book functionality.
Most email clients do as well.
You can also get such (database) functionality in stand-alone applications.
On Linux you can use <a href="http://membres.lycos.fr/fpeters/gaby/">Gaby</a> or <a href="http://pbrufal.kleenux.org/gtk-agenda.shtml">GTK-Agenda</a>.

<h2 id="office">Office Suites and Related Software</h2>

<p>
Advice on office suites:
do not use them for research.
Word processors may slow down your writing;
use a good <a href="#EDITORS">text editor</a>.
Spreadsheets are a risky way to handle data

]:
use a simple matrix programming language instead.
The virtues of existing presentation packages do not outweigh their weaknesses,
especially if you need to present mathematical formulae.
</p>

<p id="officesuites">
Nevertheless, office suites can be convenient.
Here are some basic considerations.
FOSS office suites are currently a high-quality multi-platform solution.
I recommend either <a href="https://www.libreoffice.org/">LibreOffice</a> (License: LGPL)
or <a href="http://www.openoffice.org/">OpenOffice</a> (License: Apache).
Of course most of the people you know will be using a commercial office suite,
but you will be able to save your files in formats they can read,
and as long as they are not using advanced features 
(e.g., templates, complex macros, or complex spreadsheet formulae)
you will be able to open their files as well.
Most users do not use such features.
FOSS suites meet most personal and business needs.

here are some cheap or free commercial alternatives.

<h3>Document Exchange</h3>

<p>
We exchange documents for three primary reasons:
for viewing, for interaction, and for modification.
Word processor formats are a popular choice,
and the versioning capabilities of modern word processors can be very useful in a collaborative setting.
Plain text can often satisfy viewing and modification needs,
and there are great version control tools for text formats.
When more structure is needed,
HTML will usually suffice.
When formatting must be tightly controlled or access needs to be controlled,
PDF is often a good choice.
</p>


<h3 id="wordprocessors">Word Processors</h3>

<div id="abiword">
<a href="http://www.abisource.com">AbiWord</a> is a cross-platform,
full-featured word processor with a Word&reg;-like interface.
If you want a quick viewer for MS <kbd>.doc</kbd> files (e.g., for your email),
this loads much faster than most alternatives.
It also has a wonderful equation editor,
which accepts <a href="#TEX">LaTeX</a> input in a dialogue box.
</div>

<p>
If you want even lighter weight than the very nice AbiWord,
on Linux you can try <a href="http://www.nllgg.nl/Ted/">Ted</a>.
Some Linux users like frames-oriented <a href="http://www.koffice.org/kword/">KWord</a>.
</p>

<p>
Nowadays it is perfectly feasible to use a decent HTML editor as your word processor.
The <a href="http://www.w3.org/Amaya/">Amaya browser/authoring tool</a> may be worth considering,
although I have found it a bit slow and clunky.
(Somewhat offsetting this is its native MathML support.)
Another possibility is the web development suite offered free by <a href="http://www.evrsoft.com/download/">Evrsoft</a>.
</p>

<p>
There have been some interesting efforts to provide
fairly direct use of PostScript for document markup.
A popular one was  Graham Freeman's
<a href="ftp://ftp.adfa.edu.au/pub/postscript/qsdir/Qs_README.html">QuickScript</a>,
but I can no longer find it on the web.
Another alternative,
<a href="http://www.cappella.demon.co.uk/resources/tinydict.html">Tinydict</a>,
is still around.
</p>



<h4>Cloud</h4>

<p>
It is now perfectly possible to rely on internet applications for word processing.
I have had good experiences with <a href="http://docs.google.com">Google Docs</a> for basic word processing tasks
and online collaboration.
<a href="http://writer.zoho.com">Zoho Writer</a> looks even more capable,
and has good math support as well.
(Including the ability to produce math by inputting LaTeX.)
</p>

<h4 id="bibmanage">Bibliography Management</h4>

<p>
You will need to decide what format to keep your bibliography in,
and what software to use to manage it.</p>

<p>
Citation Management:
<br />
If you use a commercial word processor you will probably use the commercial EndNote
to manage your reference and format your citations.
However there are some interesting alternatives.
In particular,
LaTeX users have the traditional (and very powerful) <a href="http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/biblio/bibtex/">BibTeX</a> to manage the citations in their documents.
Even users of commercial word processors can take advantage of BibTeX by using <a href="http://www.ee.ic.ac.uk/hp/staff/dmb/perl/index.html">Bibtex4Word</a>.
New users should see the <a href="#bibtexhints">BibTeX user hints</a>.
Now for the design of citation reference and citation style,
they have the even more powerful <a href="http://tug.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/exptl/biblatex/">biblatex</a>
(which greatly simplifies writing new styles).
(Users switching from natbib will want to know about the natbib-compatibility-mode,
which allows use of natbib's commands (e.g., \citep, \citet)
instead of the commands usually provided by biblatex (e.g., \parencite, \textcite).)

Python users can consider the bib4txt component of <a href="https://github.com/dschwilk/bibstuff">bibstuff</a>,
which should particularly interest <a href="#rest">reStructuredText</a> users who need bibliographic support.
(I recommend you get the <a href="https://github.com/dschwilk/bibstuff">most recent BibStuff</a>.) (BibStuff License: MIT; Language: Python)
Chris Putnam's <a href="http://www.scripps.edu/~cdputnam/software/bibutils/bibutils.html">Bibutils</a>
"interconverts between various bibliography formats using a common XML intermediate."
(Bibutils License: GPL; Language: C; binaries are available for many platforms.)
</p>

<p>
Users of Open Office or MS Word can insert references directly
in their documents with <a href="http://bibus-biblio.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page">Bibus</a>.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.citeulike.org/">CiteULike</a> is an interesting "in the cloud" solution
for managing references.
</p>


<h5 id="bibtex">Citation Management</h5>

<p>
The current choice for citation management appears to be <a href="http://biblatex-biber.sourceforge.net/">Biber+Biblatex</a>.
(Other possibilities are discussed below.)
The traditional choice for citation management is <a href="#bibtex">BibTeX</a>.
(See the <a href="#bibtexhints">BibTeX user hints</a>.)
</p>

<p>
Here is how to transition from
the traditional Bibtex with natbib to the more modern Biber with biblatex.
(If you have not been using <code>natbib</code>,
you can leave out that option.)
After changing your LaTeX document as indicated below
and compiling it with <code>pdflatex</code> as usual,
run <code>biber</code> on the document’s basename
(instead of using Bibtex).
</p>
<pre>
\documentclass{article}
%\usepackage{natbib} %REMOVE natbib package
%ADD biblatex package (with Biber backend)
\usepackage[
  backend=biber,
  style=authoryear-comp,
  natbib=true,
  sortlocale=en_US
]{biblatex}
%ADD .bib files (one by one, in preamble)
\addbibresource{mybib.bib}
\begin{document}
Lorem ipsum dolor \dots
\printbibliography %ADD printbibliography command
%REMOVE old bibliography commands
%\bibliographystyle{mystyle}
%\bibliography{mybib}
\end{document}
</pre>

<p>
In the background,
the choice of the <code>biber</code> back end for <code>biblatex</code>
will lead to to the creation of a <code>.bcf</code> file,
which <code>biber</code> operates on.
But you should not need to know about this
unless choose to pass to <code>biber</code>
the full filename (basename + <code>.bcf</code>) instead of just the basename.
In your document,
you will need to keep the <code>natbib</code> option to <code>biblatex</code>
as long as you use <code>natbib</code> style citation commands.
Or you can replace all your <code>citet</code> and <code>citep</code> commands
with <code>textcite</code> and <code>parencite</code> commands.

<h3 id="spreadsheets">Spreadsheets</h3>

<p>Traditional spreadsheets:
<br />
It has become very popular to use <a href="http://sunsite.univie.ac.at/Spreadsite/">spreadsheets in education</a>.
This has some downsides.
Traditional preadsheets are OK for very simple, one-off applications using small amounts of data.
For serious work,
they are too opaque, because they are too hard to document.
(If you have ever tried to figure out another person's complex spreadsheet, you know what I mean.)
Particulary well publicized was the Excel error whose correction
<a href="http://www.peri.umass.edu/236/hash/31e2ff374b6377b2ddec04deaa6388b1/publication/566/">overturned a much cited Reinhart and Rogoff study</a>.
But studies indicate that almost all large spreadsheet have serious errors.<sup><a href="http://www.j-paine.org/eusprig2001_as_html/eusprig2001.html">1</a>,<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0802.3457">2</a></sup>
Basic <a href="http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?tool=pubmed&amp;pubmedid=15214961">data handling glitches</a> have been documented even in the most popular spreadsheet applications.
The lack of transparent scripting facilities means that it is very difficult to understand someone else's spreadsheet or even one’s own spreadsheet developed months or years ago.
If all you want to educate someone to do is one-time, never-to-be-revisited, quick-and-dirty computations,
then teach them a traditional spreadsheet.
Otherwise teach them a format that allows serious documentation and transparency of manipulations.
At the very least,
eschew traditional spreadsheets in favor of <a href="#scispreadsheets">newer alternatives</a>,
such as scientific spreadsheets and engineering spreadsheets.

<p>
Comment: some problems with spreadsheets can in principle be overcome by using them directly just for data storage and then preforming manipulations via a scripting language that exploits the spreadsheet's computational and graphics facilities---on a Windows platform, perhaps VBA or better yet Python with win32com;
on a Unix platform, perhaps ABV or Python or a plug-in that supports scripting.
Of course this is not how most people use spreadsheets.
There are also engineering spreadsheets that allow explicit scripting and treat data in a more object oriented fashion.
These are tools that can be properly used for serious work.
</p>

<p>
Comment: Python can read and write tranditional spreadsheets.

<div id="scispreadsheets">
Scientific spreadsheets,
often called engineering spreadsheets,
are much better working environments than traditional spreadsheets.
A scientific spreadsheet treats data as objects
and allows programmatic manipulation in a spreadsheet-like environment.
If you use this properly, 
it can overcome many of the problems with spreadsheets while still allowing easy graphics creation.
Serious spreadsheet use will involve a lot of scripting.
You should therefore choose a scientific spreadsheet that supports an
easy to use yet powerful scripting language.
(I recommend Python.)
Here are a few possibilities.
<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://www.picalo.org/">Picalo</a>
is a data analysis tool with a spreadsheet interface to database operations.

<li>
A very simple but powerful spreadsheet application is <a href="http://code.google.com/p/simplecells/wiki/Introduction">simplecells</a>.
</li>
<li>
If you really want to attempt scientific computing using Excel,
you can treat it as a compuing engine and script it.
One interesting approach is to embed a Python interpreter in Excel using <a href="http://code.google.com/p/pyinex/">pyinex</a>.

<h4>Character Composers</h4>

<p>
A compose key allows inputting special characters as key combinations.
Some text editors provide support for this
(e.g., digraphs in Vim).
Linux includes compose-key activation as a native ability.
For Windows users,
a few are provided via the Alt key and the numeric keypad.
However, <a href="https://github.com/samhocevar/wincompose">WinCompose</a>
provides better functionality. (License: <a href="http://www.wtfpl.net/">WTFPL</a> (essentially public domain).)
(There is a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FCyNTKLyP4Q">Youtube tutorial for WinCompose</a>.)
</p>


<h4 id="calculators">Calculators</h4>

<p>
Calculators are still useful.
Here are a few of many.
</p>

<p>
Reverse Polish Notation:
<br />
The <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bc/manual/dc-1.05/html_mono/dc.html">dc</a> desktop calculator,
for those comfortable in a shell (including cmd.exe),
is cross-platform, wonderfully fast, and ever handy---highly recommended!
Another cross platform possibility is <a href="http://kalc.sourceforge.net/">kalc</a>.
For Linux you can try <a href="http://packages.debian.org/unstable/math/rpncalc.html">rpncalc</a>.
For Windows I like the freeware 
<a href="http://www.mystikeep.com/shareware/rpncalc/rpncalc.htm">RPNCalc</a>,
which is also ported to WinCE.
<a href="http://www.nthlab.com/software/rpn/welcome.html">RPN</a> is an interesting calculator for the PalmOS.
And finally for PostScript enthusiasts,
I cannot refrain from mentioning <a href="http://www.american.edu/econ/notes/pscalc.htm">PSCalc</a>.
</p>

<p>
For a console calculator,
try the cross-platform <a href="http://directory.fsf.org/GNU/bc.html">bc</a>.
(The <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/bc/manual/html_mono/bc.html">bc manual</a> is very good.)
For a graphics calculator,
try the cross-platform <a href="http://www.graphcalc.com/">GraphCalc</a>.
Or just use <a href="#gnuplot">gnuplot</a> as a graphics calculator.
<a href="http://www.fsf.org/gnulist/production/calc.html">GNU Emacs Calc</a> has many features,
including graphics using GNUPLOT.
<a href="http://www.cohort.com/CoCalc.html">CoCalc</a> is a freeware JAVA calculator.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://rascal.sourceforge.net/">Rascal</a> is enough more than a calculator that it may be considered a simple matrix programming language.
This is also true of <a href="http://hem.bredband.net/b106492/main.html">cxc</a>,
and <a href="http://web.tiscali.it/iguana.lang/">Iguana</a> seems to be evolving in the same direction.
</p>


<h4>File Compression</h4>

<ul>
<li>
The most promising free cross-platform GUI solution (well, ok, it runs under WINE in Linux) I have found is <a href="http://www.7-zip.com/">7-zip</a> (license: LGPL) and <a href="http://p7zip.sourceforge.net/">p7zip</a>,
which decompresses many formats including of course ZIP and RAR.
However <a href="http://www.lzop.org/">LZOP</a> is interesting if you do not need multiple-format support.
Currently most useful are probably the <a href="http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/tools/zip/info-zip/">Info-ZIP utilities (zip and unzip)</a>.
Also consider (for single files) <a href="http://www.gzip.org/">gzip</a>.
(Windows users may be interested in <a href="http://home.hiwaay.net/~crispen/src/#wingz">Win-GZ</a>,
which provides a Windows interface to gzip,
and the Wiz GUI for zip and unzip.
</li>
<li>
You can find web lists of freeware zip utilities for various platforms.
(<a href="http://www.thefreesite.com/Free_Software/Unzipping_compression_freeware/">FreeSite</a>|<a href="ftp://ftp.uu.net/pub/archiving/zip/WIN32/">UUNet</a>).
<a href="http://jzip.sourceforge.net/">JZip</a> is a free WinZip clone for Windows users.
Some people like <a href="http://quickzip.ifroggy.com/">QuickZip</a>.
(Of course <a href="http://sources.redhat.com/bzip2/">bzip2</a> can also open .bz2 files.)
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.pkware.com/shareware/pkzip_win.html">PKZip</a> is the classic shareware compression utility.
</li>
<li><a href="http://upx.sourceforge.net/">UPX</a> is a free, portable, extendable, high-performance executable packer for several different executable formats.
</li>
<li><a href="ftp://ftp.cs.washington.edu/pub/ntemacs/utilities/">Other
archive utilities</a> for various platforms, including Windows 95.
</li>
<li>
And of course Python users will often be well served by the <a href="http://www.python.org/doc/2.4.1/lib/module-zipfile.html">zipfile</a> module.
</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="remote">Remote Access</h4>

<h5 id="ftpclients">Terminal Emulation</h5>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://vimeo.com/24857127">Gate One</a>
(HTML 5 ssh client and terminal emulator. Nice functionality!)
</li>
<li>
<a href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">PuTTY</a>,
the classic telnet/ssh client.
</li>
<li>
Windows 10 since December 2017 has offered OpenSSH (client and server)
as an <a href="https://www.servethehome.com/say-farewell-putty-microsoft-adds-openssh-client-windows-10/">optional feature</a>.
</li>
</ul>

<p> 
Python users get a basic cross-platform solution automatically via the ftplib module.
(For an even lighter approach, try this <a href="http://mail.python.org/pipermail/python-list/2001-January/024980.html">TFTP module</a>.)
The Python Cookbook uses this module to provide a <a href="http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Cookbook/Python/Recipe/302592">threaded ftp client</a>.
As of August 2005, ftplib does not provide any secure services, however.
For SSH2 services you can use <a href="http://www.lag.net/paramiko/">paramiko</a>,
which relies on <a href="http://www.dlitz.net/software/pycrypto/">pycrypto</a>.
These are very easy installs!
(Get paramiko from the releases tab on GitHub, and see the README file for instructions.
Windows users can also look at <a href="http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/modules.shtml#pycrypto">Voidspace</a> for prebuilt PyCrypto binaries.)
I provide an <a href="http://www.american.edu/econ/pytrix/sftp_client.py">example (usable) SFTP client</a> using these modules,
but you can even have a graphical interface with SFTP support via <a href="http://home.gna.org/wxsftp/">wxSFTP</a>.
(If your needs are more substantial,
you can use <a href="http://pycurl.sourceforge.net/">pycurl</a> as a Python interface to <a href="http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/">libcurl</a>,
which should be able to meet all your ftp needs.)
</p>

<p>
If you need FTP/S, you can try <a href="http://trevp.net/tlslite/">TSLite</a>,
which offers a pure Python solution for FTP over TSL.
</p>

<p>
For Windows: I find the free and open source <a href="https://filezilla-project.org/">FileZilla</a> to be excellent for FTP and SFTP.
(In older versions, I have had some problems with FTP/S in passive mode.)
Other possibilities:
<a href="http://winscp.sourceforge.net/eng/">WinSCP</a>.
<a href="http://sshwindows.sourceforge.net/">OpenSSH for Windows</a>.
<a href="http://www.ipswitch.com/ws_ftp_reg.html">WS FTP</a>
had a free (for academics and students), easy to use, ftp program for Windows platforms,
but I think the free version went away.
<br />
For Mac:
<a href="http://icu.unizh.ch/~dkocher/cyberduck/">CyberDuck</a>.
<br />
For Un*x:
<a href="http://www.ncftp.com/ncftp/">NcFTP</a>.

<h3 id="reports">Report Generation</h3>

<p>
Generating reports is a common need.
These can be informal or presentational,
and may or may not need to be printed.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/gawk.html">gawk</a>,
a powerful report generation language which takes only a moment to learn well enough to produce simple reports.
(E.g., you can manage student grades with Gawk much more easily than with a spreadsheet.)
</p>

<p>
<a href="#reportlab">ReportLab</a> allows direct creation of PDF graphics and reports.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.lowagie.com/iText/">iText</a>
can be a very powerful report generator if you know a bit of Java.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/">Apache Formatting Objects Process (FOP)</a>
offers amazing flexibility.
Java based.
(License: Apache 2.0)
</p>

<h4>Printing Reports</h4>

<p>
Program controlled printing can be a challenge,
especially under Windows.
If you have the option of producing your reports as PDF or as appropriately formatted text,
then you can usually just ask your operating system to use a default application to print them.
Otherwise, you will have to work harder.</p>

<p>
Tim Golden offers a very useful discussion of <a href="http://tgolden.sc.sabren.com/python/win32_how_do_i/print.html">Windows printing under Python</a>.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.infres.enst.fr/~demaille/a2ps/">GNU a2ps</a> allows conversion of text (and other) files to PostScript,
as does <a href="http://linuxcommand.org/man_pages/enscript1.html">enscript</a>
and
<a href="http://www.wam.umd.edu/~zben/PostScript/asciiprint.html">ASCIIprint</a>.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://deco-cow.sourceforge.net/">wordaxe</a> can be used for hyphenation.
For example, you may want to generate your own PostScript or PDF.
As a more specific example,
the wordaxe hyphenation library offers <a href="#reportlab">ReportLab</a> support.
For an easy interface, try <a href="http://code.google.com/p/rst2pdf/">rst2pdf</a>,
which offers cascading stylesheets and supports TTF and Type1 font embedding.
</p>

<h4>Version Control</h4>

<p id="vcs">
There are many version control systems (VCSs):
see the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_revision_control_software">Wikipedia list</a>.
If you just need revision control for a single-user, single-machine project,
you can use <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/rcs/rcs.html">RCS</a>.
For simple version control on multi-user or multi-machine projects,
consider <a href="#svn">Subversion (SVN)</a>.
Currently distributed VCSs are the rage,
with <a href="http://bazaar-vcs.org/">Bazaar</a> (License: GPL),
<a href="http://mercurial.selenic.com/">Mercurial</a> (License: GPL),
and especially <a href="http://git.or.cz/">Git</a> (License: GPL) having particularly high profiles.
(Windows users of Git should consider <a href="http://windows.github.com/">GitHub for Windows</a>.)
Having a distributed VCS is not important for most small projects.
</p>

<h5 id="svn">Subversion</h5>

<p>
See my <a href="#svn-hints">Subversion hints</a>.
</p>

<p>
Despite the recent popularity of Git,
<a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a> is probably the most widely used version control system.
There is an extensive <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/">user manual</a>.
(Be sure to read about the <a href="http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.5/svn.tour.cycle.html">basic work cycle</a>.
Simplest bottom line: change to your working directory and enter
<code>svn update</code>, <em>then</em> make changes to your files.
Before you commit do another update,
and finally commit the changes with <code>svn commit -m "My message about the changes."</code>.)
</p>

<p>
The <a href="http://pysvn.tigris.org/">pysvn</a> project provides a Python based graphical interface to SVN.  
</p>

<p>
SVN on windows:
download and execute the <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/servlets/ProjectDocumentList?folderID=91">Windows installer</a>.
Users who dislike the command line should consider <a href="http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/">TortoiseSVN</a>
as a user-friendly <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">Subversion</a> client.

<h4>Shells</h4>

<p>
Windows users should no longer use <code>cmd.exe</code>,
unless forced to by circumstances.
Things have gotten better with the advent of PowerShell,
which can be run in the Windows Terminal.
Note that PowerShell support simple versions of many common bash commands.
Windows users who desire a more Linux-like shell experience
can use <code>bash</code> (or other shells)
via Windows Subsystem for Linux.

<h5>Unix Tools for Windows and System Tools</h5>

<ul>
<li>
I suggest starting by getting <a href="http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/coreutils.htm">CoreUtils for Windows</a>.
There are other <a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/voelker/ntemacs.html#other-tools">Ports of Unix tools to Win95</a>.

<h5>PDF Viewing</h5>

<ul id="pdfviewers">
<li>
The most popular viewer is the free (but closed source)
<a href="http://www.adobe.com/acrobat/">Adobe Acrobat Reader</a>.
Reader includes annotation features.
It's main downsides are that it is slow
and that it locks the file you are reading (so it cannot be overwritten).

<li>
Most browsers include very good PDF viewers (with editing capabilities).
Edge provides especially capable annotation facilities.

<h3>Data Exchange</h3>

<p>
Please let us stop playing nationalist games with number formats before someone gets badly hurt as a result.
For scientific data exchange, the decimal separator is a point (ASCII 46).
It is <em>not</em> a comma (ASCII 44).
Neither is it any other UTF code point.
It is just that simple.
Pretending otherwise is like pretending that science does not use the metric system.
</p>

<p>
Possibly the simplest open standard for fixed periodicity time-series data
is the <a href="http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/alan-isaac/econpy/blob/master/pytrix/opendatabank.htm">open-databank standard</a>.
Most time series econometrics packages support some version of this.
</p>

<p>
The most widely used data exchange format is comma-separated values (CSV).
There actually is a standard, in the form of <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180">RFC 4180</a>.
Sadly, many files with the <kbd>.csv</kbd> extension do not conform to this standard,
so caveat emptor.
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.stecf.org/software/PYTHONtools/astroasciidata/">AstroAsciiData</a>
provides simple database functionality for ASCII tables.
</p>

<p>
<a href="https://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/whatishdf5.html">HDF5</a>
"is a general purpose library and file format for storing scientific data".
Some support can be found in the econometrics community,
both in commercial and free packages.
Python users have excellent support via <a href="http://www.pytables.org/">PyTables</a>.
(To use PyTables with Python 2.4 in Windows platforms,
you will need to get the <a href="https://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/release/obtain5.html">Windows binaries</a>.)
<a href="#octave">Octave</a> and <a href="#Rproject">R</a> provide HDF5 support.
Commercial applications supporting HDF5 include Mathematica and MATLAB version 6.5+,
among many others.
</p>

<p>
The <a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/">netCDF</a> libraries
"support a machine-independent format for representing scientific data".
The netCDF distribution includes interfaces for C, Fortran77, Fortran90, and C++,
and interfaces are reportedly available for Ada, IDL, Java, MATLAB, perl, Python, R, Ruby, Tcl/Tk.
The interface provided by <a href="http://starship.python.net/~hinsen/ScientificPython/">ScientificPython</a> is supposed to be excellent.
<a href="http://www.pyngl.ucar.edu/Nio.shtml">PyNIO</a> adds to this support of additional formats.
Another possibly faster way to read the netCDF format is <a href="http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi/pupynere/">pupynere</a>,

<h2>User Hints</h2>

<h3>CSV Hints</h3>

<p>
CSV stands for comma-separated values.
Distinguish CSV and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delimiter-separated_values">DSV</a>.
CSV is described by <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180">RFC 4180</a>.
Do not give a <kbd>.csv</kbd> extension to files that fail to match this description.
</p>


<h3 id="emhints">Email Client Hints</h3>

<p>
Be sure to set your client to produce <a href="http://www.american.edu/econ/notes/ailatin1.htm">plain text</a> email.

<h4 id="mahogany_hints">Mahogany Hints</h4>

<p class="boxed">
Make Vim your editor and call it as
<br />
c:\programs\vim\vim73\gvim.exe -c "so $VIM\vimfiles\mail.vim" %s
<br />
where <kbd>mail.vim</kbd> is where you put any mail processing commands

<h4 id="thunderbird_hints">
Thunderbird Hints
</h4>

<div>
External Editor
<br />
Using your own editor when writing email is strongly recommended.
Get the <a href="https://github.com/exteditor/exteditor">"External Editor" extension</a>.
For example, use <a href="#vim">Vim</a> with Thunderbird as follows.
Define the External Editor command to load Vim as: <code>\pathto\gvim --nofork -c "setf mail"</code>,
so you will get 'mail' syntax highlighting and ftplugins loaded.
Or if you have defined say <code>mail.vim</code>,
a file of useful macro,
you can instead use e.g.,
<code>\pathto\gvim.exe --nofork -c "so $VIM\vimfiles\mail.vim"</code>.
After installing the extension,
edit the composition toolbar (the one for replying to email, <em>not</em> the main application toolbar)
and add a button for the external editor.
You can then click that button and your current email reply will be opened in Vim.
<br />
By the way,
you may find my <a href="http://econpy.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/text/vimfiles/ai_mail.vim">ai_mail.vim</a>
to contain some useful abbreviations and commands for email.
Just drop it in your <code>%VIM%\vimfiles</code> folder,
and change your External Editor command to, e.g.,
<code>"C:\Program Files (x86)\Vim\vim82\gvim.exe" --nofork -c "so $VIM\vimfiles\ai_mail.vim"</code>.
</div>

<div>
Thunderbird and Acrobat:
Acrobat will not attach PDFs to Thunderbird emails,
unless you you set Thunderbird as your default client in a very specific way.
Open the Control Panel and double click Default Programs.
Pick "Set program access and computer  defaults/Custom (expand this)/Choose a default e-mail program,
and then, click on Thunderbird.
(As of Windows 7 and Acrobat 9.)
</div>

<div>
Make sure your 'textwidth' when editing the email is no larger than 
Thunderbird's "Wrap plain text messages at" option
(in your Composition options);
otherwise when Thunderbird receives your text it may wrap it to a smaller size.
</div>

<div>
Gmail allows IMAP access,
Google provides detailed instructions for configuring Thunderbird,
and Thunderbird automates the process of adding your Gmail account.
</div>

<div>
Key Configurations:
<br />
The <a href="http://mozilla.dorando.at/">keyconfig.xpi</a> extension allows you
to easily change your key bindings.
Carefully follow the <a href="http://kb.mozillazine.org/Keyconfig_extension:_Thunderbird#Simple_built-in_commands">instructions</a>.
I like to associate the <code>d</code> key with <code>goDoCommand('cmd_delete');</code>
and the <code>x</code> key with <code>goDoCommand('cmd_MsgCompactFolder');</code>.
</div>


<h4 id="pine_hints">Pine Hint</h4>

<p>
If you prefer to POP your mail, 
you can get more control over this than Pine offers with
<a href="http://www.xnet.com/~darogers/projects.html">radiks</a>,
a tiny mail transfer program (MTA) for win32 (Windows 9x/NT/2000) which
reads mail from a pop3 server and transfers it 
(filtered, if you want) to your local hard drive.
</p>



<h3 id="scipy_hints">SciPy user hints</h3>

<p>
Use the Lapack routines if you need speed.
E.g., for a QR decomposition use scipy.linalg.flapack.dgeqrf
instead of scipy.linalg.qr.
</p>


<div>
For numarray &lt;= version 1,
there is a matrixmultiply (dot) bug:
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=5307744&amp;forum_id=4890">http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_id=5307744&amp;forum_id=4890</a>.
The multiplication is done correctly,
but the post-multiplying matrix may be changed after the multiplication is performed.
David Cooke suggests that quick fix is to define your own matrixmultiply (or dot).
E.g.,
<pre>
def dot(a, b):
    return numarray.dot(a, b.view())
</pre>
The original b is then not touched, and the screwed-up matrix is
discarded.
</div>

<div>
Suppose you find you need to import a module with the same name as your script.
First best is to change the name of your script, but you can also
<pre>
import sys
sys.path.remove('')
import sets
</pre>
to remove the current directory from Python's search path.  
If you then need access to any modules in the current directory,
use <code>sys.path.insert(0,'')"</code> first.
</div>

<p>
As late as 2004,
the Numeric and numarray documentation incorrectly stated that
<code>and</code>, <code>or</code>, and <code>not</code> would
operate element-by-element on arrays.
</p>

<p>
Lists are sorted in place, so <code>mylist.sort()</code> return <code>None</code>,
but <code>mylist</code> is now sorted.

Be careful with the definition of R’s PRNG for the geometric distribution:
<code>rgeom</code> has support on nonnegative integers,
since R has <em>p(x) = p (1-p)^x</em>.
A perhaps more common parameterization is <em>p(x) = p (1-p)^(x-1)</em>:
which you can match by adding 1 to the values returned by <code>rgeom</code>.

Windows users can access R from Python with the 
<a href="http://sunsite.univie.ac.at/rcom/">RDcom server/client</a>.
This allows you to call R
from Python as follows:
<pre><code>
&gt;&gt;&gt; from win32com.client import Dispatch
&gt;&gt;&gt; sc=Dispatch("StatConnectorSrv.StatConnector")
&gt;&gt;&gt; sc.Init("R")
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(sc.Evaluate("2+3"))
5.0
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
</code></pre>
Other approaches to R/Python interaction include the following.
<a href="http://rpy.sf.net">Walter Moreira's RPy module</a> (requires <a href="http://sourceforge.net/pywin32/">pyWin32</a> under Windows) allows you to "embed" R in Python and transparently send data to it.
(You can easily pass objects in <em>both directions</em> using OmegaHat's <a href="http://www.omegahat.org/RSPython/index.html">R/S Plus Python Interface</a>.) 
<a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyRserve">pyRserve</a> is a simpler solution,
which nevertheless allows running R on a remote server.

<h3 id="bbox_hints">Bounding Box Hints</h3>

<p>
Occasionally you will need to provide or adjust the bounding box information for a graphic.
Here are some resources.
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<a href="http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/support/pdfcrop/">pdfcrop</a>
for PDF files. (License: LaTeX Project Public License; Language: perl)
</li>
<li>
<a href="">GhostScript</a>
and many TeX distributions
include <a href="http://www.linuxcommand.org/man_pages/eps2eps1.html">eps2eps</a>,
which can reset the bounding box of an EPS file.
</li>
<li>
If you have Ghostscript 6.0 (or later), the command:
<code> gs -sDEVICE=bbox -dNOPAUSE -dBATCH file.ps </code>
will print the bounding box information for file.ps (and then exit gs).
You can then use this information to reset the bounding box.
<a href="http://www.physics.ohio-state.edu/~ntg/scripts/bbox_add.pl">bbox_add.pl</a> is a perl script that uses this approach.
<a href="http://citadel.tistory.com/130">fixBBox.py</a> is a Python script that uses this approach.
(I have not tried these scripts.)

<h3 id="abihints">AbiWord user hints</h3>

<div>
AbiWord supports easy conversion to LaTeX,
and thus easy generation of PDF versions of your documents.
Here is a simple command line approach,
given a document named test.abw to produce a document test.pdf.
<pre><code>
abiword --to=latex test.abw
pdflatex test.latex
</code></pre>
<br />
AbiWord has a special feature: it supports some vi keybindings!
To implement the vi keybindings, 
you need to make two changes your AbiWord.Profile file.
(Windows users should search for this in the Documents and Settings folder.)
First add another Scheme to your AbiWord.Profile file:
Just add the following lines to your AbiWord.Profile file right below the 
already existing "_custom_" Scheme.
<pre><code>
&lt;Scheme
		name="AbiVi"
		KeyBindings="viEdit"
		KeyBindingsCycle="1"
		/&gt;
</code></pre>
By setting KeyBindingsCycle="1"
(1 is on, 0 the default is off)
you will be able to press F12 to switch keybinding mode:
the mode will appear in the Status Bar just to the right of INS.
The second step is to go to the beginning of AbiWord.Profile and find the Select tag;
modify its scheme attribute to refer to the new Scheme you just typed.
It should then look like this:
<pre><code>
&lt;Select
             scheme="AbiVi"
             autosaveprefs="1"
             useenvlocale="1"
             /&gt;
</code></pre>
This is very cool.
You get into insert mode by pressing i and out by pressing &lt;esc&gt;.
A number of basic cursor motion keys (including h j k l w b a A ^ $) and core commands  (including O o D x) are implemented,
along with / for a search dialog.
See <a href="http://www.abisource.com/mailinglists/abiword-dev/99/April/0089.html">http://www.abisource.com/mailinglists/abiword-dev/99/April/0089.html</a> for a list of implemented commands,

When you add comments to a document,
the comments are stamped with a name, a date, and a time.
This may well be more information than you want to provide.
You can remove the name stamp from all your comments as follows.
Show the comment list: pick Comments » Show Comment List from the menus.
Select all comments: click on one, and then press ``ctrl-a``.
Change the comment properties:
right click on your selection, click ``Properties``,
pick the ``General`` tab, and change the Author field (e.g., nothing).
Unfortunately, you cannot remove the date and time stamps this way.
However, only the "modified" stamp shows to the reader,
when you change the author this way,
it should update the modified time on all the comments.

As late as version 6,
there is an error in quantile() that affects computation of the median.
Fix this yourself, or use median() instead.
To fix it, you can use the following code,
suggested on the 'gaussians' list by Ron Schoenberg:
<pre><code>
proc quantilenew(x,e,a,b,c,d);
    local w, wt, f, r, i, z;

    if minc(e) &lt; 0 or maxc(e) &gt; 1;
        errorlog "Inadmissable quantile levels";
        if not trapchk(1);
            end;
        else;
            retp(error(0));
        endif;
    endif;

    w = a + (rows(x) + b) * e;
    wt = floor(w);
    f = c + d*(w - wt);

    if wt == 0 or wt == rows(x);
         errorlog ftos((maxc(1/minc(e)|1/(1-maxc(e)))),"*.*lf",1,0) 
                   $+ " rows required for this level";
         if not trapchk(1);
             end;
         else;
             retp(error(0));
         endif;
    endif;

    r = zeros(rows(e),cols(x));
    i = 1;
    do until i &gt; cols(x);
        z = sortc(x[.,i],1);
        r[.,i] = z[wt] + f .* (z[wt+1] - z[wt]);
        i = i + 1;
    endo;

    retp(r);

<li>
To transform part of a multi-dimensional array to a matrix:
first transpose the array with <code>atranspose</code>, 
so that the two dimensions that you want in your matrix are in the two last dimensions of the array.
Then extract the matrix with <code>getmatrix</code> using the appropriate locator.  
</li>
<li>
Representing infinities:
__INFn &lt; x &lt; __INFp for all real numbers x,
and the usual "extended" real number properties apply.
(Note the <em>double</em> underscore for these special constants.)
</li>
<li>
If you need to trap an error so your program can continue after an error is detected,
use the <code>trap</code> and <code>scalerr</code> commands.
(See the example for 'scalerr' in the GAUSS Command Reference.) 
</li>
<li>
GAUSS provides more than one command for singular value decomposition.
Ron Schoenberg comments:
"If you are having problems with svd1, switch to lapsvdusv.  Svd1 is an older
but faster version based on Eispack source code.  Lapsvdusv (as well as
other lap* functions) are built on the more recently developed, more
advanced Lapack source code.  They are somewhat slower than the old
functions however, and that is why the older functions have been kept in
GAUSS."
</li>
<li>
To raise a negative number to a non-integral power,
use <code>complex(b,0)^x</code>,
where <var>b</var>&lt;0 is the base and <var>x</var> is the exponent.
</li>
<li>
You can create a 4&times;4 matrix of null strings as <code>let string a[4,4]="";</code>.
But what if the dimensions <var>r</var>, <var>c</var> are not known ahead of time?
Then use <code>a=""$+zeros(r,c);</code> instead.
</li>
<li>
Version 6 introduced a variety of new functions for working
with Excel files, including a function for computing the terminating 
column: xlsGetSheetCount, xlsGetSheetSize, xlsGetSheetTypes, xlsMakeRange, xlsReadm, xlsReadsa, xlsWrite, xlsWritem, xlsWritesa.  Note that the function xlsMakeRange computes the terminating column.

<li>
Graphs:
GAUSS allows the user to set the viewer application via the _pvwr global.
The default on Unix/Linux is ghostview; on Windows it's vwr.exe.
When you use tgauss to batch process your GAUSS program,
you may want to to suppress the auto-exec viewer functionality: just set _pscreen=0.
If your program draws several graphs,
the default for GAUSS 3.6+ is that only the last one is accessible in the TKF file viewer.
GAUSS draws each over the previous one.
To get GAUSS to tile the graph windows (as in previous versions)
<br /><code>
call setvwrmode("many");
</code><br />
at the top of your command file.
To return to putting all graphs in a single window 
(for example, to produce an "animated" effect),
<br /><code>
call setvwrmode("one");
</code><br />
Note that if you do not like the default colors
for the lines you can change them:
see the help for <code>_pcolor</code>.
If you do not like the default colors
for the graph characteristics (ticks, frame, labels, background, etc)
you can change them:
see the help for <code>_pmcolor</code>.
</li>
<li>
You can save GAUSS plots in Encapsulated PostScript (<acronym class="help" title="Encapsulated PostScript">EPS</acronym>) format.
Graph conversion is determined the the global variable <code>_pcmdlin</code>.
To convert a graph into a ps file (flag -c ) stored in
"c:\filename.eps" (flag -cf ), include the line
<br />
<code>
_pcmdlin = "-c=1 -cf=c:\\filename.eps";
</code>
<br />
in your program right before creating the graph.
(Note the double backslash.)
Alternatively, in the window displaying a GAUSS graph, pick <kbd>File</kbd>, <kbd>Convert</kbd>, <kbd>PostScript</kbd>.
Then search your disk for <kbd>cvt*.eps</kbd> to find your new .eps file.
(The filename and other parameters are configurable in pqgrun.cfg, which you should definitely take a look at.
For example, you need to set <code>cvt_color = RGB</code> if you want color graphs.)
<br />
As of GAUSS 7,
I noticed that _pcmdlin is not documented.
This suggests that you need to set the .tkf file names by setting the <code>_ptek</code> global,
and then use the tkf2eps function to convert the .tkf files to Encapsulated Postscript.
The syntax is: <code>ret = tkf2ps("mytekfile.tkf", "myepsfile.eps");</code>
(see the GAUSS Command Reference).
</li>
<li>
GAUSS handles complex numbers.
For example, you can produce the complex number 2-3i with the code
<code>i = sqrt(-1);x=2-3*i;</code>.
Note that GAUSS does not set the value of <var>i</var> by default;
and you can pick any variable you want for this purpose.
</li>
<li>
In the <code>for</code> command in GAUSS the loop indicator is not a floating point.
Up to v.3.2.44, you need a hack if you want to pass the loop indicator to a procedure
(e.g., to convert it to a character value). For example, the following code works.
<pre><code>
  for i (1,10,1);
    j= i;
    print $ftocv(i+0,8,0) $ftocv(j,8,0);
  endfor;
</code></pre>
but it won't if you just pass i (or, oddly, 0+i).
(In order to get a fast loop, the loop indicator is given special status in the compiled code and is not simply a float.
The work-around generates some extra machine code that solves the problem.
See <a href="http://www.aptech.com/AS_supportMF.html">Aptech's bug page</a> for details).
</li>
<li>
As of version 3.6,
the use of <code>for</code> loops is not safe in <em>recursive</em> procedures.
This is supposed to be fixed in version 3.7 or later.
</li>
<li>
If your computations should not produce complex numbers,
turn complex numbers off by calling sysstate(8,0).
This will cause a fatal error if log, ln, or sqrt, are passed negative arguments.
If you expect real results from a procedure that can produce complex values (e.g., fft),
force the matrix to be real like this:
<code>
if abs(imag(x)) &le; 1e-12 ;
x = real(x);
endif;
</code>
For real symmetric matrices,
be sure to compute eigenvalues with <code>eigh</code> instead of <code>eig</code>:
this guarantees real eigenvalues and is much faster than <code>eig</code>.
Furthermore, if you use <code>eig()</code> for a real symmetric matrix,
rounding error in the calculations will nearly always produce complex
eigenvalues with imaginary parts that are very small.
</li>
<li>
There is something of a problem with the inverse ChiSquare function <code>cdfchii</code> through GAUSS 4.0 and possibly later.
Test with the following code snippet:
<code>cdfchii(0.9998,13);</code>
As one might expect, the same problem arises for the inverse gamma function.
Test with the code snippet <code>2*gammaii(13/2,0.9998);</code>
</li>
<li>GAUSS can generate .ps or .eps files.
If you want to add these to a Web document,
use ghostscript to convert to a portable anymap .ppm
file, then use
<a href="http://www.uni-frankfurt.de/doc/man/hpux">ppmtogif</a> to convert to gif.
</li>
<li>
If you are using the Windows version of GAUSS and
you are using OPTMUM, set __optmum = 1. To keep the
iterative information from going to an output file, set
output off before calling Optmum and then turn it back on
after the Optmum returns.  For better screen output when
__optmum = 2, set the font to "terminal"  (there's a font
menu in the Gauss window).
</li>
<li>To determine if a variable holds numeric or character
value is to do a  string comparison (it works with character but not with numeric).  For example:
<br />
<code>
let x1 = 4;
let x2 = a;
<br />
s1 = "" $+ x1;
s2 = "" $+ x2;
<br />
if (s1 $== x1); "ok"; endif;
if (s2 $== x2); "ok"; endif;
<br />
</code>
Only the second equivalence (s2 $== x2) is true.
</li>
<li>
GAUSS 3.5 installation: Aptech advises you to put the license file into the \Gauss35\Flexlm.
However, as soon as Gauss35 starts up, it begins looking for
the license file in the \Gauss35 directory.
Make sure you do not have an old license file there; it can cause a lot of trouble.
</li>
<li>
To get nice looking output from, e.g., Maxlik,
open a DOS window before calling the program. E.g.,
<br />
call DOSWinOpen("Your Title Here", error(0));
<br />
{x,f,g,cov,ret} = maxlik("tobit",0,&amp;lpr,x0)); @or whatever@
<br />
DOSWinCloseall;
<br />
(Unfortunately the DOSWinOpen will cause GAUSS for Windows 3.5 (up to Kernel rev.
3.5.17, GUI rev. 3.5.14 to shut down.)
</li>
<li>
Up through GAUSS 3.5, there is a bug in the polyeval() procedure that prevents it from calculating matrix polynomials.
The bug is easily fixed.
Just open the file poly.src and change the line
<br />
            <code>y = y * x + diagrv(zeros(rc,rc),c[i]);</code>
            <br />to
            <br />
            <code>y = y * x + diagrv(zeros(rx,rx),c[i]); @changed rc to rx@</code>
</li>
<li>
Up through GAUSS 3.6.20,
if a space is placed immediately after previously
#define'd flag in #ifdef statement, a code between
#ifdef-#endif is not compiled. For example, the
following code
<pre>
#define A
print "---";
#ifdef A 
/*space ^ */
/*here  | */
   print "A";
#endif
print "===";
</pre>
yields
<pre>
---
===
</pre>
as its output.
</li>
<li>
In order to assign values to a sequence of names,
use <code>varput()</code> and <code>ftocv()</code>.
For example,
<pre><code>
for i(1,5,1);
  varput(eye(i),"x"$+ftocv(i,1,0));
endfor;
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
It is possible to call GAUSS from a batch file,
using tgauss.exe.
Since tgauss doesn't use a user interface,
and can be much faster.
Just create a dos batch file containing lines like
<code>c:\gauss\tgauss.exe -b c:\mypath\myfile.gau</code>
where you need to adjust the paths appropriately.
The <code>-b</code> flag is used to call GAUSS in batch mode.
Save the batch file (e.g., as filename.bat).
As with any batch file, you can double click it to run it
or run it from the command line.
</li>
<li>
Suppose you want to print a large matrix to a text file.
You may be able to just reset 'outwidth' to provide the needed line length,
but outwidth has a maximum value.
If your matrix is too big for this,
convert the matrix into a string array using ftostrC and then write it to a file using fputst.
Ron Schoenberg provided the following example (given the matrix <var>x</var>):
<pre><code>
    sa = ftostrC(x,"%8.4lf");
    fp = fopen("matrix.asc","w");
    call fputst(fp,sa);
    fp = close(fp);
</code></pre>

(assuming that's where you put it, of course).
You may want to change your path so that aspell is in it.
<br />
Running Aspell from Vim:
To run aspell from Vim, just add a mapping to your _vimrc or .vimrc file.
Here are two examples.  The first assigns spell checking to the familiar F7 key.
<pre><code>
map &lt;f7&gt; &lt;esc&gt;:w&lt;cr&gt;:!aspell check %&lt;cr&gt;:e! %&lt;cr&gt; </code></pre> (Use the complete path if you didn't put aspell in your path).  Note that if you take this approach the changes are permanent! (I.e., you cannot "undo" them.)  Leave out the last command if you want to be able to change your mind.
Here is a slightly different version.
<pre><code>
map &lt;Leader&gt;s &lt;esc&gt;:w&lt;cr&gt;:!aspell --dont-backup -c %&lt;cr&gt;:e! %&lt;cr&gt;&lt;cr&gt; </code></pre>
To understand these,
see the Aspell and Vim helpfiles!
In either case, make sure aspell is in your path or use the fully qualified file name.

Redirection:
see <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/redirection.mspx?mfr=true">Microsoft's documentation</a>.
I often need to redirect all script output to a text file,
both stdout and stderr.
Example:
<pre>
c:\Python27\python.exe -c "import scipy;scipy.test()" &gt;c:\file.txt 2&gt;&amp;1
</pre>
In PowerShell, use the <code>out-file</code> commandlet.

<!-- c:\Python27\python.exe -c "import scipy;scipy.test()" >c:\temp\temp.txt 2>&1 -->

<h3 id="pyx_hints">PyX user hints.</h3>

<div>
Installing PyX from <a href="#vcs">SVN</a> gets you the most recent changes and is trivially easy.
(Preliminary: install <a href="#vcs">SVN</a>.)
At the command line, create a build directory with
<code>svn co https://pyx.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/pyx/trunk/pyx pyx</code>
and then change to your new <kbd>pyx</kbd> directory and enter <code>setup.py install</code>.
</div>

<div>
PyX will produce EPS files with negative bounding box parameters.
This is perfectly legal but confuses some applications.
In particular, LaTeX users of dvipdfm may see a clipped figure.
Fixing this is simple:
ask PyX to write your figure with a specified
<a href="http://pyx.sourceforge.net/manual/node20.html">paperformat</a>.
E.g.,
<pre><code>
mygraph.writeEPSfile("c:/mydir/myfig.eps",paperformat=pyx.document.paperformat.Letter)
</code></pre>
</div>

<div>
One lovely use of PyX is to <a href="http://pyx.sourceforge.net/manual/epsfile.html">include an existing EPS file</a>
and add things to it (e.g., LaTeX text, or JPEG graphics).
When you write out the result with <a href="http://pyx.sourceforge.net/manual/node20.html">writeEPSfile</a> method of your canvas,
be sure to set <code>bboxenlarge=False</code> to ensure a "tight" bounding box.
</div>

<p>
For 2-D data plots,
Titus Winters has written a nice <a href="http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~titus/pyxTutorial/">PyX tutorial</a>.
</p>

<p>
Be sure to see the <a href="http://pyx.sourceforge.net/examples/index.html">examples</a>
and <a href="http://pyx.sourceforge.net/gallery/index.html">gallery</a>
on the PyX website.
I provide a <a href="http://www.american.edu/econ/notes/pyx_shadedintegral.py">heavily commented elaboration of the shaded integral example</a>.

<h3 id="miktexhints">MiKTeX user hints.</h3>
<div>
MiKTeX comes with dvipdfm configured as
<pre>
D "mgs.exe -q -sPAPERSIZE=a0 -sDEVICE=pdfwrite -dCompatibilityLevel=1.2 -dUseFlateCompression=true -dNOPAUSE -sOutputFile=\"%o\" \"%i\" -c quit"
</pre>
Some applications (e.g., PyX) produce negative bounding boxes.
(See <a href="#pyx_hints">Pyx hints</a> for a PyX solution.)
While perfectly legal,
this creates a problem for dvipdfm.
During conversion to PDF,
the EPS files are clipped at the papersize boundary rather than the figure boundary.
I don't know how to force pdfwrite to behave nicely,
and epstopdf does not work because it intentionally alters the bounding box for the PDF file.
You can try it though by changing the MiKTeX configuration to:
<pre>
D "epstopdf --outfile=\"%o\" \"%i\" "
</pre>
</div>

<div>
If you are generating PDF files directly,
you can also feed PDF images directly to dvipdfm using specials:
<pre><code>
\begin{figure}[ht]
	\special{pdf:image (mydir/myfile.pdf)}
\end{figure}
</code></pre>

<h4>Adding a program as a Tool:</h4>
<ol>
<li>
From TextPad's <kbd>Configure</kbd> menu,
select <kbd>Preferences</kbd>.
</li>
<li>
Click on <kbd>Tools</kbd>, then
click on the <kbd>Add</kbd> button, then
select <kbd>Program...</kbd>
</li>
<li>
The "Select a File" window pops up.
Select the executable file (.exe) that
you want to add as a tool.
</li>
<li>
Click on <kbd>Apply</kbd>.
Double click on "Tools" and you should see your executable file listed as a tool.
Click on it, and you will see some dialog boxes.
Make sure they are correctly filled,
being especially careful with the "Parameters" box.
(You will find it useful to look at TextPad's help
on Tool Parameter Macros.)
</li>
</ol>

<h4>Adding TeX as a Tool (thanks to Alan Cibils):
</h4>

<ul>
<li>Add TeX to your Tools by following the directions for adding a program as a Tool.
  <ul>
  <li>emTeX users will add tex386.exe, which they will find in the <kbd>emtex/bin</kbd> folder.
  </li>
  <li>MikTeX users will add <kbd>texify.exe</kbd> (recommended) or <kbd>latex.exe</kbd> which should be in the <kbd>texmf\miktex\bin</kbd> folder
  </li>
  <li>TrueTeX users will add <kbd>Initex32.exe</kbd> which should be in the <kbd>SWP3\TCITeX\TrueTeX</kbd> folder.
  </li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>In the dialog boxes of the final step,
replace <code>$File</code> in the <kbd>Parameters</kbd> box with
<code>&amp;latex $FileName</code>.
(MikTeX users can simply use <code>$FileName</code>.)
Click on "Apply"
</li>
</ul>

<p>To LaTeX (the disk copy of!) your current document, select your TeX from the "Tools" pull-down menu.
<br />
IMPORTANT: When you LaTeX a document in TextPad, a <kbd>Command Results</kbd> document is opened.
When LaTeX finishes executing, it displays the message:
Process completed with exit code 1.
<strong>
YOU MUST CLOSE THIS WINDOW AFTER EVERY RUN.</strong>
Failure to do this will cause subsequent LaTeX or BibTeX runs to hang.
</p>

<p>
To avoid the afore mentioned problem, I recommend running MikTeX as a DOS command, which can also be done as a TextPad tool.
If you decide on this option, go to the TextPad menus <kbd>Configure, Preferences, Tools</kbd>.
Click on <kbd>add</kbd> and select <kbd>DOS Command</kbd>.
A window will appear in which you type the full path to the
command you wish to execute. For example, for MiKTeX  type:
<br />
<code>
c:\texmf\miktex\bin\texify.exe $BaseName
</code>
(If you use the default MiKTeX installation, you do not need a fully qualified path name.)
<br />
Click <kbd>OK</kbd>, then <kbd>Apply</kbd>,
then go to the tool you just added
(it should be listed under Tools when you expand it)
and make sure to <em>UNcheck</em> the "capture output" box.
<br />
If you do all of this, then when you select the tool, a DOS window will pop open and show you the execution results. This is useful for when you have compilation errors,
you can hit enter, "X" or whatever,
whereas the other way you can't.
<br />
Older versions of TextPad have a small bug:
the DOS window closes upon the end of execution of your tool, whether the close window box is clicked or not.
</p>



<h4>Adding  <a href="ftp://tug.ctan.org/tex-archive/biblio/bibtex/8-bit/">BibTeX</a> as a Tool:
</h4>
<p>Note that the <kbd>texify</kbd> command offered in MikTeX automatically runs BibTex for you.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Add bibtex.exe or Bibtex32.exe to your Tools by following the directions for adding a program as a Tool.
</li>
<li>In the dialog boxes of the final step,
replace <code>$File</code> in the <kbd>Parameters</kbd> box with
<code>$BaseName</code>.
Click on "Apply"
</li>
</ul>
<p>To LaTeX your current document, select Bibtex32 from the "Tools" pull-down menu.
<br />
IMPORTANT: When you LaTeX a document in TextPad, a <kbd>Command Results</kbd> document is opened.
When LaTeX finishes executing, it displays the message:
Process completed with exit code 1.
<strong>
YOU MUST CLOSE THIS WINDOW AFTER EVERY RUN.
</strong>
Failure to do this will cause subsequent LaTeX or BibTeX runs to hang.
</p>


<h4>Add a .dvi viewer to your Tools, to view your LaTeXed document:
</h4>
<ul>
<li>Add your .dvi viewer to your Tools by following the directions for adding a program as a Tool.
  <ul>
  <li>emTeX users will probably choose to add dviwin2.exe.
  </li>
  <li>MikTeX users will probably choose to add <kbd>yap.exe</kbd>.
  </li>
  <li>TrueTeX users will probably choose to add <kbd>Dvigdi32.exe</kbd> which should be in the <kbd>SWP3\TCITeX\TrueTeX</kbd> folder.
  </li>
  <li>
  Mac users may use <a href="http://docenti.ing.unipi.it/~d9615/homepage/mac.html">TeXniscope</a>, MacDviX, or Mxdvi.
  </li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>In the dialog boxes of the final step,
replace <code>$File</code> in the <kbd>Parameters</kbd> box with
<code>$BaseName</code>.
(TrueTeX users will need to use <code>$UNIXDir/$BaseName</code>.)
Click on "Apply"
</li>
</ul>
<p>To view your LaTeXed document, select your viewer from the <kbd>Tools</kbd> pull-down menu.
</p>


<h4>Since you can choose to have MikTeX produce .pdf files instead of .dvi files, you may wish to add the Adobe .pdf viewer to your Tools, to view your LaTeXed document:
</h4>
<ul>
<li>Download and install the free Acrobat Reader, and add it to your Tools by following the directions for adding a program as a Tool.
</li>
<li>In the dialog boxes of the final step,

<h4>Reassign Keyboard Short-Cuts</h4>
<p>Reassign Ctrl-e to WordRightEnd as follows:
choose Customize from the Configure menu,
select the Keyboard tab,
choose Cursor from the Categories list,
choose WordRightEnd from the Commands list,
type Ctrl+e in the Press New Shortcut box,
click Assign, and click OK.
You will then want to assign Ctrl+Shift+E to WordRightEndExtend.

Using version control with Mma notebooks is a bit messy but can be made fairly workable.
In a Mathematica notebook that you want to put under version control,
go to <code>Format » Option Inspector...</code> in the menu.
In the top-left dropdown, set the option scope <code>Selected Notebook</code>.
Find <code>FileOutlineCache</code> under <code>Notebook Options » Private Notebook Options</code>,
and set this option to <code>False</code>.
(This may make opening the notebooks a bit slower.)
Similarly,
under <code>Editing Options</code>,
set <code>TrackCellChangeTimes</code> to <code>False</code>
<br />
Command approach:
<pre>
SetOptions[InputNotebook[],
 PrivateNotebookOptions → {"FileOutlineCache" → False},
  TrackCellChangeTimes → False
   ]
</pre>
Save your notebook and it will save with much less clutter
and many fewer changes.
To do even better,
as a preliminary to committing your changes,
delete all your output cells and then save your notebook.
(You can use the menus or <code>FrontEndTokenExecute["DeleteGeneratedCells"]</code> for this.)

On campus:
To fix font problems on the display,
make sure the Windows Multilingual Support is installed.
If that is not an option, go to Tools, User Setup, Font Mapping
and check the Use Symbol Font mapping box.
</p>

<p>
Be sure to learn the keyboard short-cuts:
see especially the help for Key Prefixes.
For example, you can logical negation as <kbd>ctrl-s,N</kbd> 
and the partial derivative sign (&part;) as <kbd>ctrl-s,d</kbd>.
(See the Help search.)
Also, I strongly recommend changing the default settings under Tools, UserSetup, Math:
set it so that two spaces switches to math and a space at the end of math switches to text.
</p>

<p>Be sure to visit Yngve Svendsen's <a href="http://swp.yngve.com/">
Scientific WorkPlace Unofficial Homepage</a>
(although I have had some connection difficulties).
</p>

<p>
<b>Graphics:</b> When using the JPGs or TIFFs,
edit the file tcispech.ini and change the setting for MaxGraphicsMemoryUsage.
Try doubling or tripling the default setting of 4000.

When using <acronym class="help" title="Encapsulated PostScript">EPS</acronym> graphics, save your document using the Portable LaTeX filter and change the options for the graphicx package to use dvips. The graphics will only appear when printing, but they should appear.

To use Scientific Word on the EagleNet,
you will first need to install some (non-executable) files on your computer
(which ought to have say 30Meg free disk space and 8Meg RAM);
do this by entering "enetupgr sword" (without the quotes) at the DOS prompt.
(Note: be sure to keep your macros in a <em>separate</em> file, which you \input in your preamble.)
Be sure to see the
<a href="http://swp.yngve.com/index.html">Scientific Workplace Unofficial Homepage</a>,
which include <a href="http://swp.yngve.com/technical/miktex01.html">instructions</a> on how to use MiKTeX with SWP.

You can get all the functionality of Scientific Word
except for the typesetting and associated TeX functions in
<a href="http://www.mackichan.com/snbk/default.htm">
Scientific Notebook</a> for Windows 9x and NT.
Many useful functions are in the
<a href="http://www.mackichan.com/products/freedwnld.html">
free Demo version</a>, although this version cannot print, save, or copy from read/write documents.
While you are on the AU campus, you are in luck:
Scientific Notebook is available as an EagleNet Application.
<br />
Users must first open EagleNet Applications.
(If you don't have EagleNet on your Start menu,
just pick Start, Run and the type `nal' in the dialog box.)
You should see a Math/Statistics/Research
folder on the left, in which you will find the
Scientific Notebook icon.
Double click the icon to run the program.
<br />
The first time you run the program, several system files
will be copied down to your hard drive before the program opens.
Each time after that initial setup the program will run
as soon as the icon is double-clicked.
The program is accessible to the major academic user groups
and all student users.
Since it is a 5-user license, you may occasionally find you have to wait  until someone logs off to use Scientific Notebook. I do not expect this to happen, but if it happens to you let me know and I will apply for more copies.

<h3 id="svn-hints">Subversion User hints</h3>

<p>
Subversion is easy to use and excellent for individuals and small groups.
Here is a <a href="http://www.clear.rice.edu/comp314/svn.html">ten minute tutorial</a>.
Windows users who prefer to avoid the command line can just use <a href="http://tortoisesvn.net/">TortoiseSVN</a>.
</p>

<div>
Remember your work cycle must be a very rigid UMUC sequence:
1. before you start work, *update*
2. *modify* your working copy (do your work, and test it)
3. *update* again (and resolve any conflicts)
4. as soon as possible, *commit* your changes
</div>

<div>
To work across platforms,
you must not use file or folder names that are illegal on any of the platforms.
Windows users cannot use the following (which are reserved device names):
CON, PRN, AUX, NUL, COM1, COM2, COM3, COM4, COM5, COM6, COM7, COM8, COM9, LPT1, LPT2, LPT3, LPT4, LPT5, LPT6, LPT7, LPT8, and LPT9.
They also cannot use these names followed by an extension, for example, NUL.txt or com1.png.
<br />
Suppose a contributor creates com1.png on a Mac and commits it to the Subversion repository.
When Windows users try to update, the update fails horribly.
(How horribly? Unfixably. They will have to get a new checkout after the problem is fixed.)
The contributor of the file should ``svn rename`` it to a name legal for Windows,
and commit that change.
Then the problem for Windows users will go away.
<br />
Bottom line: never ever use such file or folder names!
</div>

Suppose you want to add a directory <kbd>mydir</kbd> under version control,
but it contains a bunch of files you do <em>not</em> wish to track.
You can add the directory but not the files as follows:
<code>svn add --non-recursive mydir</code>.
</div>

<p>
One disappointing thing: it would be nice to add a directory
and all its files <em>except</em> those matching the <code>svn:ignore</code> property.
Subversion does not currently support this.
Here is one <a href="http://svn.haxx.se/users/archive-2006-02/0678.shtml">work around</a>.
</p>

<p>
You can set an editor (e.g., for commit messages and property editing)
in the Subversion <code>config</code> file.
On Windows you should be able (after installing Subversion) to find it here:
<code>\Users\YourUserName\AppData\Roaming\Subversion</code>.
Search for <kbd>editor-cmd</kbd> and follow the instructions.
(On Windows, I am currently using <code>editor-cmd = C:/programs/Vim/vim74/gvim.exe -f</code>.
If you use a path with spaces in it, you will have to quote it.)
</p>

<p>
Once you ensure that Subversion has access to a text editor,
you can edit the list of patterns it will ignore in any directory.
E.g., <code>svn propedit svn:ignore .</code> (note the final period)
will edit the patterns for the current directory.
</p>

<p>
<code>svn diff -r HEAD myfile</code> shows differences between <kbd>myfile</kbd> and the repository.
<code>svn status --show-updates</code> shows you which files in the repository have changed.
</p>

<p>
It is useful (and probably best practice) for any plain text files to
<code>svn propset svn:eol-style=native *filename*</code>.
This is not the default, but each user can make it a personal default by editing
the <code>[autoprops]</code> of their Subversion <code>config</code> file.
From Subversion 1.8 onwards, it can be set as a default at the repository level
with <a href="http://blogs.collab.net/subversion/the-road-to-repository-dictated-configuration-day-2-autoprops">Repository Dictated Configuration</a>.
</p>

<p>
It is a good idea to lock binary files, to help ensure only one person changes them at a time:
<code>svn propset:needs-lock yes *filename*</code>.
</p>

<h3 id="reST_hints">Docutils User hints</h3>

<div>
If you are using rst2latex,
it will include the following in your header:
<code> \usepackage[T1]{fontenc} </code>.
Unfortunately, on its own, this will probably lead to the
use of bitmap fonts and thus "fuzzy" screen output.
According to Guenter Milde,
there are several reasons for this choice.
<ul>
<li> 
T1 is the recommended (by the LaTeX team) font encoding. (OT1 is the
default only because of the TeX policy of no changes to the defauls,
not even improvements/fixes.)
</li> 
<li>
Using the advantage of the several output options for a common source,
documents for web viewing are best produced with the HTML writer and
the print version with the LaTeX writer.
</li>
<li>
While the bad look will be visible at first glance,
use of the traditional OT1 encoding will make text extraction faulty.
(That is, it creates problems with search and extraction of text that
contains characters outside the ASCII range.)
</li>
</ul>
The real question is what to do about it.
The recommended workaround is to select a T1-encoded "Type 1" (vector) font.
For example you can use Latin Modern either by adding it to your LaTeX style sheet
(<code>\usepackage{lmodern}</code>)
or by using a Docutils command line argument
(<code>--stylesheet=lmodern</code>).
Another popular solution is the "Times/Helvetica/Courier" combination,
which you can get by adding the following to your style sheet:
<pre>
\usepackage{mathptmx}            % Times for serif and math
\usepackage[scaled=.90]{helvet}  % downscaled Helvetica for sans serif
\usepackage{courier}             % Courier for teletype (mono-space)
</pre>
or with the following Docutils command line options:
<code>--documentoptions="scaled=.90" --stylesheet="mathptmx,helvet,courier"</code>.
<br />
You can also just turn it off with the following Docutils command line option:
<code>--font-encoding=OT1</code>
(or even <code>--font-encoding=""</code>).

<h3 id="mpl-hints">Matplotlib User Hints</h3>

<p>
Matplotlib is included in many Python distributions,
including Enthought Canopy.
If you install it your self,
be sure to read the <a href="http://matplotlib.org/users/installing.html">installation instructions</a>.
Before installing Matplotlib,
you will certainly need to install <a href="#numpy">NumPy</a>.
</p>

<p>
To get the most from Matplotlib,
you need to clearly understand the difference
between a figure instance and an axes instance.
<br />
A figure instance the basic container for an entire chart,
like a figure in a journal article.
A figure instance can contain multiple axes instances,
each of which can be used for plotting or drawing.
<br />
We can call the <code>add_subplot</code> method to add
non-overlapping axes instances to our figure.
(But if you call <code>add_subplot</code> again
in a way that overlaps your previous subplot,
this **replaces** your previous axes in the current figure.)
</p>

<pre> 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
fig1 = plt.figure()
ax1 = fig1.add_subplot(1,1,1)
#now draw on ax1
fig2 = plt.figure()
ax2a = fig2.add_subplot(2,1,1)
#now draw on ax2a
ax2b = fig2.add_subplot(2,1,2)
#now draw on ax2b
</pre>

<p>
You can use the <code>subplots</code> convenience function
to do figure and axes creation at one go.
</p>

<pre>
fig, ((ax1,ax2),(ax3,ax4)) = plt.subplots(2,2)
</pre>

<p>
Here is a simple example for creating a figure
and displaying it onscreen.
(For completeness, we illustrate the explicit choce of
a GUI “back end”, although this is usually not necessary.)
Note the hierarchical approach:
the <kbd>pyplot</kbd> interface creates the figure object,
the figure object creates the axes objects,
and the axes objects create the other objects
(including, implicitly, the axis objects).

Matplotlib's pyplot facilities are convenience facilities for the user with modest needs.
For some examples (e.g., embedding Matplotlib in other applications)
it is important not to use these facilities.
In this case,
you can altogether avoid using pyplot,
but you will need to handle figure and canvas creation yourself.
</p>

<pre>
# example by John Hunter.
from matplotlib.backends.backend_svg import FigureCanvasSVG
from matplotlib.figure import Figure
fig = Figure()
ax = fig.add_subplot(211)
ax.plot([1,2,3])
ax.set_xlabel('time')
canvas = FigureCanvasSVG(fig)
canvas.print_figure('myfile.svg')
</pre>

<p>
As another example,
here is our earlier example redone to be more fully object oriented.
</p>

<pre>
# preliminaries
from matplotlib.backends.backend_agg import FigureCanvasAgg as FigureCanvas
from matplotlib.figure import Figure
# create a new figure
fig = Figure()
ax = fig.add_subplot(111)
ax.plot([1,2,3],'r-')
ax.set_title('Easy OO Line Plot')
ax.set_xlabel('x')
ax.set_ylabel('y')
canvas = FigureCanvas(fig)
canvas.print_figure('temp.eps')
</pre>

All Matplotlib plotting functions trigger autoscaling.
This affect, e.g., setting the axes limits.
To prevent your limits from being overridden,
call xlim/ylim <em>after</em> any plotting functions.
Alternatively, you can turn autoscaling off:
<br />
<code>gca().set_autoscale_on(False)</code>
</p>

<div>
Subplots are pretty close to each other:
if you stack two and label both horizontal axes,
the top plot's label overlaps the bottom plot's axis.
Fix this by using <a href="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/matplotlib.figure.html#Figure-subplots_adjust"><code>Figure.subplots_adjust</code></a>,
like this:
<pre>
figure()
subplots_adjust(hspace=0.4)  # default: 0.2
subplot(211)
subplot(212)
</pre>

Matplotlib is capable of fully object oriented graphics programming.
There is a very useful <a href="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/leftwich_tut.txt">tutorial</a>.
If you want to embed Matplotlib in a GUI,
you must use the object oriented API and <em>not</em> pyplot.
The Matplotlib website includes <a href="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/examples/">examples of embedding</a>.
(For example, <a href="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/examples/embedding_in_qt.py">embedding_in_qt.py</a>.)
</p>

<p>
<a href="http://agni.phys.iit.edu/~kmcivor/wxmpl/">wxmpl</a>

<div>
Changing Matplotlib backends:
you have to call 'use' before importing matplotlib.pyplot;
the backend choice must be set at the time of the matplotlib.pyplot import.
For example,
<pre>
import matplotlib
matplotlib.use('GTKAgg')
from matplotlib.pyplot import *
</pre>
</div>

<div>
If you need to control the placement of a Matplotlib figure,
you need to work a bit because it is "back end" dependent.
According to John Hunter, "the matplotlib Figure is
embedded in a FigureCanvas which is typically a GUI widget embedded in
a GUI Window. In the pylab interface, the canvas is managed by a
FigureManager, which has a window attribute on most of the backends."
He provides some examples.
<pre>
<code>
# GTK backend 
from pylab import * 
import gtk
figure(1)
plot([1,2,3])
manager = get_current_fig_manager()
# see gtk.Window class docs at
# http://www.pygtk.org/pygtk2reference/class-gtkwindow.html
manager.window.set_position(gtk.WIN_POS_CENTER) 
figure(2)
plot([1,2,3])
manager = get_current_fig_manager() 
# see gtk.Window class docs at
# http://www.pygtk.org/pygtk2reference/class-gtkwindow.html
manager.window.set_position(gtk.WIN_POS_NONE) 
show()
</code>
</pre>
Another user offered a WX example:
<pre>
<code>
# WX* backend (manager.window is a wxFrame)
# http://www.lpthe.jussieu.fr/~zeitlin/wxWindows/docs/wxwin_wxframe.html#wxframe
figure(1)
plot([1,2,3])
manager = get_current_fig_manager()
manager.window.SetPosition((100,100))
#or: manager.window.Centre()
show()
</code>
</pre>
Todd Miller offered a TkAgg example:
<pre>
<code>
# set the window position to X=200, Y=300
get_current_fig_manager().window.wm_geometry("+200+300")
</code>
</pre>
</div>

<div>
To get the
equivalent of gnuplot's <code>set xzeroaxis</code> and <code>set yzeroaxis</code>,
use <code>axhline()</code> and <code>axyline()</code>.
Prior to version 0.63,
Matplotlib does not have an equivalent of gnuplot's <code>set xzeroaxis</code>.
(This draws a horizontal line across the xrange at y=0.)
John Hunter explains how to achieve the same effect,
and it provides many insights into matplotlib.
"What you want to do is plot a line where the y coord is in data units and equal
to zero, and the x coord is in axes units and spans the xrange.  The
line stretches from left to right regardless of the xlimits.
Each axes provides a data transform and an axes transform, so that you
can specify lines/text/etc in either coord system; axes coords are 0,0
for lower left and 1,1 for upper right.  But what you want to do is
mix the data and axes transforms for x and y.  The transforms module
provides a helper function for this.  The following code is freestyle
(untested) but should work:
<pre><code>
from matplotlib.transforms import blend_xy_sep_transform
ax = gca()
trans = blend_xy_sep_transform( ax.transAxes, ax.transData)
plot([0,1], [0,0], transform=trans)
</code></pre>
</div>

<div>
You can set an arbitrary color for any matplotlib plot.
E.g., <code>pyplot.plot(d, f(d), color = (1,0,0))</code>.
</div>

<div>
To get rid of the redundant ticks on the top and right edges:
<pre>
ax = pyplot.gca()
ax.get_xaxis().set_ticks_postion('bottom') 
ax.get_yaxis().set_ticks_postion('left') 
</pre> 
</div>

<div>
Note that you should call <code>show</code> only once in a script.
But sometimes you want to alternate seeing plots and
doing computations.
See <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/458209/is-there-a-way-to-detach-matplotlib-plots-so-that-the-computation-can-continue
">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/458209/is-there-a-way-to-detach-matplotlib-plots-so-that-the-computation-can-continue
</a> for a discussion.
</div>

<div>
In an Axes3D object,
the .xaxis and .yaxis refer to the axis for the draw space,
<em>not</em> to the the 3d projected axis.
The latter are .w_xaxis, .w_yaxis, and .w_zaxis.

<div id="eviews_bugs">
Eviews 6 appears to have some bugs and some annoyances:
<ul>
<li>
If you run a program that shows a graph and then creates and new page in your workfile,
the old page remains active. (Very serious!)
</li>
<li>
String concatenation does not work when string variables are used in commands.
</li>
<li>
Table copying to clipboard is very badly broken.
Tables can be copied to clipboard only as tab deliminted text.
This is almost useless: it does not reproduce the table formatting.
Space delimited text would be more useful.
RTF is clearly needed.
LaTeX would be helpful.
</li>
<li>
Table writing to disk is very badly broken.
The tab-delimited text export does not reproduce the table formatting
(e.g., of regression results).
It looks like this is essentially a CSV table with tabs substituted
for commas: is anyone actually using this format?
Space delimited text would be more useful:
at least it could be directly inserted in a document.
HTML export of user modified tables (e.g., of regression results) is buggy.
RTF export works OK:
one must assume this is the only option used by the EViews developers.
</li>
<li>
Text objects have no useful methods.
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
Kawa offers a very useful collection of <a href="http://aris.ss.uci.edu/econ/personnel/kawa/codes/eviews.html">supplemental programs and data in EViews format</a>,
including the NBER historical series and the PENN World Tables.
</p>

<p>
EViews 5 can read and write <a href="http://www.eviews.com/eviews5/eviews5/ev5over.html#Formats">many data formats</a>.
</p>

<p>
Up to version 4,
the <code>save</code> command is not correctly documented in the EViews documentation.
If you provide a filename as an argument, it is really equivalent to <kbd>File.SaveAs</kbd>.
That is, it saves under the new name <em>and</em> changes the name of the current workfile.
In fact, as of version 4, this is the only way to change the name of a workfile in RAM.
</p>

<p>
In Eviews3, you could use <code>scat(r)</code> to get in a single graph
multiple scatter plots with their regression lines.  This is not possible in
EViews4, where the replacement <code>linefit</code> command only uses the first
two members of its group argument.
</p>
<p>
missing observations:
@obs(x[,s]) gives you the number of non-missing observations in x in the current sample or in sample "s" if the option is listed.
One can access the number of non-missing observations for a group with @comobs.
</p>

<div>
String substitution is very useful in EViews.
For example, you might write set a string variable, say <code>%param1</code>, equal to a complicated function of parameters, which recurs in a system estimation.
As a simple example:
<pre>
%param1 = "c(1) + c(2)"
system1.add y = c(1)* x1 + x2/({%param1})
</pre>
Oddly, string substitution only works for procs (commands) and not for assignments (using = ).
For example,
<pre>
scalar trythis = ({%param1})
</pre>
doesn't work.
(In this case, EViews will look for an object named c(1)+c(2) without evaluating the expression.)
</div>

<p>
Backwards compatibility:
Eviews 3 and EViews 4 are not fully compatible.
See the version 4 User's Guide page 532:
"A Note on EViews Backward Compatibility" and page 580/581: "Converting from Version 3 Sspace"
for some changes from version 3 to version 4.
Briefly:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
"makeendog" is changed to "makegroup"
</li>
<li>
"makestat" is changed to "makestats" (do not confuse with "makestate")
</li>
<li>
with solving models the assign statement is replaced by scenarios, and
the default scenario operates as if you had specified "assign @all _0" in
version 3; hence in version 4 endogenous variables are not overwritten but
new variables are created instead.
</li>
<li>
<code>legend(s)</code> becomes <code>legend columns(1)</code>
</li>
<li>
the r option for <code>scat</code> is not supported.
</li>
</ol>

To reduce the image image resolution, use a video filter.
E.g.,
<code>ffmpeg -i myinfinle.mp4 -vf scale=iw/2:ih/2 myoutfile.mp4</code>
(Here <code>iw</code> and <code>ih</code>
hold the input resolution width and height.
See the <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-filters.html">filters documentation</a>.)
<!-- ffmpeg -i video1429831824.mp4 -vf scale=iw/2:ih/2 ..\..\econ372s2022\recordings\zoom-20220204.mp4 -->
<!-- ffmpeg -i video1718443938.mp4 -vf scale=iw/2:ih/2 ..\..\econ672s2022\recordings\zoom-20220125.mp4 -->
<!-- ffmpeg -i video1995210725.mp4 -vf scale=iw/2:ih/2 ..\..\econ672s2022\recordings\zoom-20220405.mp4 -->
<!-- ffmpeg -i zoom-20220405.mp4 -ss 3510 -c:v copy -c:a copy zoom-20220405-trimmed.mp4 -->
<!-- ffmpeg -i zoom-20250415.mp4 -vf "crop=in_w:in_h-187:0:0, scale=iw/2:ih/2" .\zoom-20250415crop.mp4 -->
</p>

<p>
To extract part of an MP4 file, copy the audio (<code>acodec</code>) and video (<code>vcodec</code>)
for a stime range. E.g.,
<code>ffmpeg -ss 00:00:00 -to 00:10:00 -i myinfile.mp4 -acodec copy -vcodec copy myoutfile.mp4</code>
extracts the first 10 minutes.
(See the <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-utils.html#time-duration-syntax">documentation of time durations</a>.)
</p>
<!-- ffmpeg -ss 00:03:15 -to 00:04:00  -i video1648072430.mp4 -vf "crop=in_w:in_-70:0:0, scale=iw/2:ih/2" $home\dpt\courses\econ705\2024f\test.mp4 -->

<p>
You can pipe a series of frames (e.g., Matplotlib graphs) to FFMPEG to produce an animated graph.
</p>
<p>
You can create PNG files named (frame000.png, frame001.png, etc) and do
<code>ffmpeg -b 8000 -f mpeg2video -r 30 -i frame%03d.png movie.mpeg</code>.
You can also produce an AVI like this:
<code>ffmpeg -r 10 -i frame%03d.png -f avi -vcodec msmpeg4v2 -y movie.avi</code>.
<!-- l:\software\ffmpeg\ffmpeg.exe -r 2 -i temp%03d.png -f avi -vcodec msmpeg4v2 -y movie.avi -->
Works great!
Note that AVI supports very low framerates; MPEG does not.

Vim is free and open source software;
get it here: https://www.vim.org/.
If you are new to Vim,
get some <a href="https://www.vim.org/docs.php">documentation</a>.
Be sure to do the Vim tutorial and to read the help for "navigation".
If you want additional documentation,
consider <em>Vi Improved&mdash;Vim</em> by Steve Oualline or
<em>Vim ge-packt</em> by Reinhard Wobst.
</p>

<p>
Windows installation hints:
<br />
Installation creats a <code>vim</code> directory.
Below that is a <code>vimfiles</code> directory.
For Windows users who are new to Vim,
i. copy my <a href="https://github.com/alan-isaac/econpy/blob/master/text/vimfiles/share_vimrc.vim">share_vimrc.vim</a>
file to your vimfiles directory,
and then 
ii.
look for the <code>_vimrc</code> file in your <code>vim</code> directory
and add at the bottom of that <code>_vimrc</code> file
the following command:
<code>source $VIM/vimfiles/share_vimrc</code>
</p>

<p>
Getting started:
<br />
Look for a file called <code>vimtutor</code>
or <code>vimtutor.bat</code>.
Set aside 20 minutes for the tutorial,
and then run the tutorial
(e.g., by clicking the file icon).
When you want to go deeper,
look at the <a href="http://vimcasts.org/">Vimcasts videos</a>.
</p>

<p>
The Vim cursor stays in the viewing window,
in contrast with some Windows applications.
If you want to cursor down and then return to where you started,
set a mark before moving.  (See <code>:h marks</code>.)
But, if you want to be able to page down and then page back up to where you started,
use <code>ctrl-d</code> and <code>ctrl-u</code> rather than <code>Pg-Dn</code> and <code>Pg-Up</code>.
</p>

<p>
Digraphs allow simple and intuitive keyboard entry of unicode characters.
Vim digraphs are based on <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1345.html">RFC 1345</a>.
See ``:h digraph-table``.
</p>

<p>
To find the non-ASCII characters in a file,
use a regular expression.
To search for characters outside of the ASCII range,
search for <code>[^\x00-\x7F]</code>.
(Alternatively, use decimal values: <code>[^\d0-\d127]</code>.)
However to search for individual non-ASCII characters,
see the help for <code>%o</code>.
</p>

<p>Colorscheme:
<br />
Vim provides excellent syntax highlighting in various color schemes.
There is an <a href="http://cocopon.me/app/vim-color-gallery/">online gallery</a>.
You can get a list of all the installed colorschemes by entering
<code>colorscheme &lt;ctrl+d&gt;</code>
at the Vim command line.
(Do not forget the space.)
I particularly like <code>koehler</code>, a rather dark color scheme.
(<a href="https://github.com/rodnaph/vim-color-schemes/blob/master/colors/koehler.vim">Download from GitHub.</a>)
You can set this by entering <code>colorscheme koehler</code> at the Vim commmand line.
Another popular dark color scheme is <code>solarized</code>.
(<a href="https://github.com/altercation/vim-colors-solarized">Download from GitHub.</a>)
To determine your current color scheme, enter <code>echo g:colors_name</code>
at the command line.
(If you did the tutorial, you know you can reach the command line
by pressing <code>Esc</code> 
</p>

<p>
Buffers:
<br />
A buffer is a file open for editing.
Use the <code>:ls</code> command to list your current buffers.
This list is <em>not</em> interactive.
However, while looking at this list,
you can e.g. enter <code>:b10</code> to switch to buffer 10.
</p>

<p>
Tabs:
<br />
Vim uses tabs in a unique way.
They are called tab pages,
and they are essentially an arrangement of windows open on some of your buffers.
(A buffer is a file that has been opened for editing;
a window is an area to view a buffer,
and a tab page is a collection of windows.
</p>

<p>
Vim has excellent syntax highlighting.
However, by default it does not use a lot of context.
In many settings, I find it useful to set
<code>syn sych minlines=300</code>.
When necessary, you can <code>syn sych fromstart</code>,
but this may cause a slowdown in very large files.
(See the help for <code>syn-sync</code>.
</p>

<div>
Python:
<br />
Vim cooperates with some scipting languages, including Python.
See <code>:help :python</code>, <code>:help python-examples</code>,
and especially <code>:help python-vim</code>.
Start with
<pre>
:python import vim
:py cb = vim.current.buffer
</pre>
Note that cb is now an iterable container of strings.
You can assign to the i-th line by assigning to cb[i].
</div>

<p>
Exiting a buffer: it is usually recommended to exit a buffer using bnext.
However I sometimes prefer to delete a buffer as I leave it.
Examining the help for ``bar``,
we see that ``:w|bd`` can be used to write and then delete a buffer.
</p>

<p>
MiKTeX:
<br />
With minimal effort,
Vim cooperates wonderfully with LaTeX.
Windows users should install MiKTEX,
and then perhaps add my <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/alan-isaac/econpy/master/text/vimfiles/ai_texmenus.vim">MiKTeX menus</a> to the <kbd>_gvimrc</kbd> file.
</p>

<p>
Vim 7+ includes spell checking.
Spell checking is affected by syntax highlighting,
which identifies groups (e.g., comments).
For spell-checking longer LaTeX documents, I find I need to
<code>setl spell syntax spell toplevel</code>.
This ensures spellchecking of text that is not in a syntax item.
To make this permanent, you can include it in
<code>~/.vim/after/syntax/tex.vim</code>.
You can also the values of
<code>syn sync maxlines</code>
and
<code>syn sync minlines</code>
in the same file. (See the help for <code>:syn-sync</code>.)
If the file is not too big, you can even always start from the top with
<code>syntax sync fromstart</code>.
</p>

<p>
Learn to yank to registers.
For example, to yank (i.e., copy) the entire buffer you are working on
into the clipboard, use <code>:%y+</code>.
(The colon move to command mode,
the percent sign picks all lines,
the <code>y</code> is to yank,
and the plus sign picks the clipboard register.)
</p>

<p>
To remove the BOM from a file,
<code>set nobomb</code>.
</p>

<p>
There is a nice book devoted to learning Vim:
<a href="http://www.iccf.nl/click5.html">Vi IMproved by Steve Oualline</a>,
also called the VIM book.
You can view the <a href="http://www.truth.sk/vim/vimbook-OPL.pdf">Vim book online</a>.
</p>
<p>
Be sure to try <a href="http://lanzarotta.tripod.com/">Jeff Lanzarotta's bufexplorer.vim</a>.
(One warning: as of early 2001,
the buffer delete command in bufexplorer uses bd!,
so changed buffers will be deleted upon request without a warning.
Change this to bd.)
</p>

<p>
Thesaurus:
You can adapt the <a href="http://www.dcs.shef.ac.uk/research/ilash/Moby/mthes.html">Moby thesaurus</a> for use with Vim.

<p>
Note that for all systems the Vim distribution is split into an archive with

<p>
Count the occurences of a pattern with <code>:%s/pattern//ng</code>.
Count the number of words in a file with <code>g ctrl-g</code>.
</p>
<p>
To change line spacing see the help for <kbd>linespace</kbd>.
To change the font in gvim,
you can use the menu dialog <kbd>Edit/SelectFont</kbd>,
or you can include your selection in your <kbd>_gvimrc</kbd> file.
(I use <code>set guifont=andale_mono:h9,courier_new:h10</code>.)
Text editors should only use <a href="#monospace">monospace fonts</a>.
</p>
<p>
If you type very slowly, you need to slow down Vim's macro recognition.
See the help for <kbd>map-typing</kbd>.
I recommend resetting timeoutlen according to the example in the help for <var>timeoutlen</var>.

<h3 id="ps_hints">PostScript User hints</h3>

<p>
If you want to fill an entire page with background color,
you do not need to know the dimension of the page.
Just start your PostScript program by setting the color
and then giving the command <code>clippath fill</code>.
(Of course few printers can print to the exact edge of the page.)
</p>

<p>
Transparency:
PostScript uses an opaque imaging model.
It does not support transparency.
However, there is a workaround available if you have Adobe Distiller.
You can add a "PDFMark" to your Postscript file
to set the transparency for an object.
When Adobe Distiller processes this PDFMark,
it will set the transparency for the object.  
Lancaster offered an <a href="http://www.tinaja.com/glib/pstrans.pdf ">early discussion</a>.

Use <code>pdflatex</code> to compile your documents.
Use <code>tikz</code> for your drawings.
</p>

<p>
To get double spacing, use <code>\usepackage{setspace} \doublespacing</code>.
This should leave your figures and tables alone.
</p>

<div>
Do not use the eqnarray environment.
<a href="http://www.tug.org/pracjourn/2006-4/madsen/">Lars Madsen explains why.</a>
Instead use one of the beautiful amsmath environments.
</div>

<p>
For nice theorem and proof formatting,
consider combining the following three packages:
<code>amsthm</code>,
<code>thmtools</code>, and
<code>thmbox</code>.
(The last is just to redefine the <code>proof</code> environment.
</p>

<p>
If you use linerange markers with the <kbd>listings</kbd> package,
make sure your markers do not include hyphens.
(These will be treated as indicating the linerange break.)

The <a href="http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/pict2e/?action=/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/">pict2e</a>
package provides much needed additional functionality to the LaTeX picture environment.
As of June 2004, however, there is a small bug:
be sure to end <code>qbezier</code> and <code>cbezier</code> commands with an immediate comment character,
to avoid breaks in line continuity.

Using LaTeX to produce PDF files with graphics is pretty easy
as long as you are producing <a href="http://silas.psfc.mit.edu/elec_fig/">clean graphics</a>.
But you need to pay attention to some details.
</p>
<p>
If you are producing your PDF files with dvipdfm,
then you will
find it easiest to use EPS graphics.
(EPS is also the primary standard for publishers.)
Historically this has been my preference,
but lately I've been working more with pdflatex.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
Problem: a few applications (mostly on Windows) do not produce EPS graphics.
In this case, you can produce JPEG files and either
        i. learn how to include .jpg files, or
        ii. <a href="#jpeg2eps">convert JPEG to EPS</a> or <a href="http://code.google.com/p/sam2p/">sam2p</a> (which is fast and easy),
        iii. switch to pdflatex
</li>

<li id="impgraph">
If you are using pdflatex to produce your PDF files,
you cannot include EPS graphics directly.
You can either
  <ol>
    <li>
    convert your EPS graphics to PDF, using <a href="http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/support/eps2pdf/">eps2pdf</a>
    </li>
    <li>
    produce your graphics in a supported format, such as PDF or JPEG
    </li>
    <li>
    set up your document to <a href="http://www.trevorrow.com/oztex/ozfaq.html#pdfeps">convert EPS to PDF on the fly</a>
  </li>
  </ol>
Trevorrow suggests leaving off the extension (.eps) when you <code>includegraphics</code>
and putting the following in your preamble:
<pre>
\ifx\pdfoutput\undefined
% we are running LaTeX, not pdflatex
\usepackage{graphicx}
\else
% we are running pdflatex, so convert .eps files to .pdf
\usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
\usepackage{epstopdf}
\fi 
</pre>
</li>
</ol>
In any case, use the <a href="http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=impgraph">graphicx package</a>
and include your graphics. Example:
<pre><code>
    \documentclass{article}
    \usepackage{graphicx}
    \begin{document}
    \begin{figure}[htp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{c:/temp.eps}
    \caption{Test Figure}
    \label{f:mytestfig}
    \end{figure}
    \end{document}
</code></pre>
Note the forward slash in the path name, as always with TeX.
(You can omit the path if you
i. keep your graphics files in the same folder as your .tex file,
or ii. configure your LaTeX to look in the folder containing your graphics files.)
</div>

<p>
On the one hand it is easy enough to zip up all your <acronym class="help" title="Encapsulated PostScript">EPS</acronym> files with the embedding LaTeX document.
On the other hand,
one of the attractions of the LaTeX picture environment was that your drawings were present in your <kbd>.tex</kbd> file.
Here is a way to get almost the same thing with <acronym class="help" title="Encapsulated PostScript">EPS</acronym> files.
Add the <kbd>moreverb</kbd> package.
Put your <acronym class="help" title="Encapsulated PostScript">EPS</acronym> file in a <kbd>verbatimwrite</kbd> environment in your <kbd>.tex</kbd> file.
You will have to provide a file name that it will be written to,
but once it is written you can read it into a figure as usual.
(An alternatie is to generate your figures with embedded gnuplot commands,
using the <a href="http://www.tug.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/egplot/">egplot</a> package.)
</p>

<div>
If you need to wrap text around a figure,
use the <kbd>wrapfig</kbd> package. Include
the package (in your preamble) and then the
syntax is almost like that for the figure environment.<pre>
\begin{wrapfigure}{R}{2in}
\includegraphics[width=2in]{example.eps}
\caption{Example Caption}
\label{fig:xmpl}
\end{wrapfigure}
</pre>
</div>

<h3 id="bibtexhints">BibTeX User hints</h3>

<ul>
<li>
        The most important hint will undoubtedly prove the least welcome,
        but here it is anyway:
        restrict your characterset in your BibTeX databases as follows.
        For the cite key use only ASCII characters,
        and do not use the colon or plus sign.
        Instead of the key <code>name1+name2:date:journal</code>
        use the key <code>name1.name2-date-journal</code>.
        <br />
        This is not for the sake of LaTeX use,
        but rather to allow you to use your database with other applications
        where <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/types.html#type-name">id and name tokens</a> may be restricted.
        Suppose for example you want to use your keys as
        the <code>name</code> or <code>id</code> attribute
        in an HTML or XML document.
        The colon is allowed in HTML but is reserved in XML for namespace specification.
        The plus-sign is not allowed in either specification.
        XML allows a whole bunch on non-ASCII characters but HTML does not.  
</li>
<li>
        <a href="http://www.tug.org/pracjourn/2006-4/fenn/">Managing Citations and Your Bibliography with BibTeX</a>
        by Jürgen Fenn 
        is a good introduction to using BibTeX.
</li>
<li>
        If you use cross referencing in your .bib files, there are two important peculiarities.
        Any book entry that is crossreferenced must come after the referring entry in your .bib file.
        Also, BibTeX cannot use the TITLE field in the referenced entry in place of a BOOKTITLE field in the referring entry.
        So in your referenced entry you should include both a TITLE and a BOOKTITLE field (despite these being duplicative).
        This should be fixed in BibTeX version 1.0 and above.
</li>
<li>
        When you create a BibTeX data base, use appropriate capitalization for all titles.
        Lower case will be forced by certain styles (like AU-CMS), so you do not have to worry about that.
        But other styles will maintain the capitalization you provide, and these rely on your correct provision.
</li>
<li>
        Use obvious cite keys (like <code>mankiw.etal-1994-qje</code>)
        so that your bib files remain useful to you years later.
</li>
<li>
        When entering months, always use the default abbreviations
        (e.g., <code>month = jan,</code>) so that months will end up correctly formatted.
        (If you say, <code>month="Jan.",</code> it will always be formatted that way.)
</li>
<li>
        Page ranges should be entered in LaTeX format, e.g. 29--32 not 29-32.
</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="gnuplot-hints">Gnuplot User hints</h3>

<p>
Since gnuplot is a plotting package,
it offers limited data manipulation facilities.
These can be increased by the use of gawk,
which gnuplot can talk to nicely.
Alternatively you can manage your data in Python and use a Python interface to gnuplot,
such as <a href="http://gnuplot-py.sourceforge.net/">Gnuplot.py</a>.
If you use Jupyter’s IPython,
which is a good idea,
you can try the included enhanced version: Gnuplot2.py.
In either case,
if you use gnuplot's <code>fit</code> command,
you should consider <a href="http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=5687034">how to get the results back into Python</a>.
</p>

<p>
There are
<a href="https://github.com/Gnuplotting/gnuplot-palettes/blob/master/README.md">palettes</a>
(themes)
for gnuplot.
</p>

<p>
Be sure to use the valuable documentation that gnuplot includes.
Begin by typing "help introduction" at the gnuplot prompt,
since this explains the syntax used in the help documents.
<br />
Note: if you download gnuplot for Windows as a ``.zip`` file,
the gnuplot help file (wgnuplot.chm) does not work properly.
Windows blocks it.
To unblock it, right click on the file,
pick ``Properties``, and then press ``Unblock``.  
Please be sure you have an official release before doing this.
</p>

<p>
The command to load a script is <code>load</code>.
Provide your file name in quotes, using forward slashes.
</p>

<p>
Remember that gnuplot distinguishes integers and floats by the presence of a
decimal point.
Make sure your real numbers are recognized as real by including a decimal point.
Integer division produces an integer result.
For example, $3/2=1$ but $3./2=1.5$.
</p>

<p>
To easily plot a cobweb plot (i.e., Verhulst diagram with gnuplot,
see <a href="http://www.jaist.ac.jp/~s1060005/article/?gnuplot_cobweb">this article</a>.
</p>

<p>
Setting the color of plots is not well documented.
Do it by setting the linetype variable.
To see the linetypes, type <kbd>test</kbd> at the gnuplot command line.
</p>

<p>
To draw a 3-D scatterplot, try
<br />
splot 'data.asc' with points palette
</p>

<p>
You can draw a line segment by setting an arrow with the "nohead" parameter.
</p>

<div>
Suppose you want a log scale on the y axis but you want to display the numbers as base raised to an exponent.
<pre>
set log y 2.0
set format y '2^%L'
</pre>
</div>

<div>
The basic way to place single points is with the <code>label</code> command.
Use the 'front' option to make sure that they are placed after lines are plotted.
If you know the location,
you can also place a point as a data plot of a single value. E.g.,
<pre>
<code>
plot '-' with points ps 3
1 1
e
</code>
</pre>
centers a point at (1,1).
</div>

<p>
If you would like to use gnuplot to create a drawing with no plots in it this is possible.
Just be sure to set the <code>yrange</code>,
then <code>plot 0/0</code> after all your drawing commands.
</p>

<p>
Up to version 3.8j, <kbd>gnuplot</kbd> arrowheads are not offset to account for their miter.
This means they generally extend past the point where you expect them to stop.
There is no satisfactory workaround, but you can try drawing a filled arrow with a very narrow pen and then redrawing just the tail (as a headless "arrow") with a thicker pen.
</p>

The article on the Opera website about how to install the Adobe <acronym class="help" title="Scalable Vector Graphics">SVG</acronym>
Viewer states: "Please note: SVG may not work correctly, some users
report that the images do not animate, even though they are
displayed."
You can overcome this with a bit of work.
Install the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/svg/viewer/install/beta.html">Adobe SVG Viewer version 6 beta release</a> of v6 of the Adobe SVG viewer,
then copy three DLLs to the Opera Plugins directory.
(The Adobe SVG Viewer v6 beta release passes almost all of the W3C SVG compliance suite.)
Just follow the installation instructions. 
Once it is installed,
copy the following files to the Opera\Program\Plugins directory:
<pre>
NPSVG6.DLL
SVG6RFF.DLL
SVG6RR.DLL
</pre>
Restart Opera and test the plugin at the

New LaTeX users on Windows may wish to read <a href="http://www.pinteric.com/miktex.html">these hints</a>
</p>

<div>
Suppose you want to use a non-standard document class,
say a thesis class to format your LaTeX thesis.
You need LaTeX to be able to find the class (.cls) and class option (.clo) files.
Here are some options for providing this information.
(For more information, see the <a href="http://docs.miktex.org/manual/localadditions.html">MiKTeX documentation</a>.)
<ul>
<li>
Put them in the same folder as your thesis.
</li>
<li>
Put them in an arbitrary folder that you point to by setting the <var>TEXINPUTS</var> environment variable.
(E.g., on Windows you might use the
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/set.mspx?mfr=true">set command</a>
or go to Advanced System Settings via the Control Panel.
Users of the Bash shell might use the <code>export</code> command.)
</li>
<li>
Put them in an arbitrary folder that you point to by using the <code>--include-directory</code> option when you call pdflatex.
</li>
<li>
Put them in a properly (TDS) structured <kbd>localtexmf</kbd> folder,
and then refresh your LaTeX database.
</li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
To include graphics in your document,
use the <kbd>graphicx</kbd> package.
Keep your images grouped together,
and point to them with the <code>\graphicspath</code> command.
(Some knowledgeable users suggest setting <var>TEXINPUTS</var> instead,
e.g., <a href="http://www.latex-project.org/cgi-bin/ltxbugs2html?pr=latex/2618">http://www.latex-project.org/cgi-bin/ltxbugs2html?pr=latex/2618</a>.)
Note the odd syntax for <code>\graphicspath</code>:
each path must be in braces and must end with a forward slash.
If you want an images directory searched recursively
(say because you put each chapters images a separate folder),
end the path with a double slash.
E.g., <code>\graphicspath{{images-eps//}{images-pdf//}}</code>.
</p>

<h4 id="tikz-hints">TikZ hints</h4>

<p>
Most important:
the <a href="http://paws.wcu.edu/tsfoguel/tikzpgfmanual.pdf">TikZ/PGF manual</a> is very helpful.
Also, Crémer provides a <a href="http://cremeronline.com/LaTeX/minimaltikz.pdf">useful introduction</a>.
</p>

<p>
The intersection coordinate systems are very useful.
E.g., <code>(A |- B)</code> takes the first coordinate from A and the second coordinate from B.
See the PyX manual.
</p>

<p>
The <code>arc</code> command feels odd, especially to those with PostScript experience.
Instead of inputting a circle center, you must give the start point for the arc.
Suppose we want to draw an arc from from a circle centered at (1,1) with a radius of 2,
say from 30 degrees to 60 degrees.
You can do that like this:
<code>\draw (1,1) +(30:2) arc (30:60:2)</code>
</p>

<p>
Parametric plots are easy. E.g.,
<code>\draw[domain=-20:0, smooth, variable=\t, samples=200] plot({cos(\t r)*exp(0.1*\t)}, {-sin(\t r)*exp(0.1*\t)});</code>
</p>

<p>
To place text along a line, use the <code>sloped</code> keyword:
<code>\draw (0,0) -- (5,1) node[above,very near end,sloped] {text}</code>
</p>

<p>
You can use <code>tikzset</code> to set the default arrowhead style for your document:
<code>\tikzset{>=latex}</code>.
</p>
<!-- chk -->

<p>
Predefined line thicknesses are:
ultra thin, very thin, thin (the default),
semithick, thick, very thick, ultra thick.
You can also set the line width explicitly:
<code>\draw[line width=0.5pt]</code>.
</p>
<p>
A very light gray is <code>black!10</code>.
A very dark gray is <code>black!90</code>.
</p>

<p>
Use <var>pgfplots</var> for plots.
The manual is good,
and most tasks have very easy and obvious solutions.
A few odd things are obscure.
E.g., <a href="http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/55718/how-can-i-add-a-zero-line-to-a-plot">adding a zero-line</a>
to a plot.
</p>

<p>
When supplying images to accompany articles,
depending on the journal,
the TikZ format may not be acceptable.
Fortunately, it is easy to create standalone PDFs from TikZ figures.
Use the <code>standalone</code> documentclass.
</p>
<pre>
% myfig.tex
\documentclass[tikz]{standalone} %standalone figure
\begin{document}
\begin{tikzpicture}
  \draw (0,0) -| (5,5) -| (10,10); %tightly cropped!

Installation
(with thanks to <a href="http://arturo-servin-research.blogspot.com/2007/08/gnuwin32.html">Arturo Servin</a>)
and the <a href="http://getgnuwin32.sourceforge.net/">GetGnuWin32 developers</a>.
<ol>
<li>
Download the <a href="http://getgnuwin32.sourceforge.net/">getgnuwin32</a> project maintenance utility.
(This will download and install the tools for you.)
</li>
<li>
Run the executable file you downloaded.
It will ask you for a destination to decompress the file.
This will be a temporary directory: you will eventually delete it.
I will assume you use c:\temp\getgnuwin32.
(You can choose whatever you want.)
To install, you can just follow the instructions.
(If you want details you can check the readme file included with the package.)
</li>
<li>
Comment: If you are behind a proxy,
you may have to configure wget (using bin\wget.ini).
</li>
<li>
Run download.bat.
(This file is well documented.
If you wish to change the defaults---e.g., the default mirror site for download---
edit the file before running it, and save your changes.)
As it runs, download.bat will download the applications packages.
This can take a while.
</li>
<li>
When dowload.bat finishes running,
run install.bat.
(This will decompress the downloaded packages.)
</li>
<li>
<em>Copy</em> the folder getgnuwin32\gnuwin32 to a new folder C:\programs\gnuwin32.
(Or anywhere else you want.)
</li>
<li>
Change to your newly filled C:\programs\gnuwin32 folder
and run the file update-links.bat.
This should complete the installation process (by updating any orphan links).
You are now ready to use your new tools.
</li>
</ol>
Optionally:
<ul>
<li>
Copy the &ldquo;Start Menu&ldquo; folder
(which you will find inside your gnuwin32 folder)
to the Start Menu of your windows desktop.
When executed the shortcuts inside will automatically start a cmd in the path of gnuwin32.

<li>
Add environmental variables as recommended in the <a href="http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/install.html">GnuWin32 docs</a>.
(Recommended.)

<li>
Add the full path to your gnuwin32\bin folder to your PATH.
</li>
<li>
Delete your temp\getgnuwin32 folder.

<p>
There are more options.
I do not use them and they can confuse some windows applications using the same name as those in the gnu package,
so I will not explain.
If you are interested, check the readme file.
