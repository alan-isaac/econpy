The file bergmann1990.bas contains a transcription of the BASIC program
in Bergmann, Barbara (1990), Micro-to-Macro Simulation: A Primer with
a Labor Market Example, Journal of Economic Perspectives.
The article provides detailed documentation of the model.
I commented out the file handling and referenced this documentation.
I also added bergmann1990.py, a simple translation into Python.
Perhaps unfortunately, I made changes for readability in the Python code.
