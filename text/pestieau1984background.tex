\title{Background on Pestieau 1984}
\maketitle

Here we give some background on the \citet{pestieau-1984-oep} model.


\section{Theoretical Model}

The model is basically a 2-period overlapping generations model with a single production sector.

An individual of generation t lives 2 periods, $t$ and $t+1$ (p.408).
Works only first period.

First period (p.408):
born,
receive bequest $b$,
work for real wage $w$ (equal to MPN) and with ability $a$ earn $wa$,
consume $c_{1}$,

Note that income is exogenous.

Period 1 knowledge (used to pick $c_{1}$):
own inheritance ($b$),
income ($wa$), $r$, number of children ($n$).

Note that knowledge of $r$ should imply forward looking expectations,
given his assumed timing.

(but use r@t-1 for simulation!!!) p. 412

Tentative consumer problem:
\begin{equation}
\max_{c_{1},c_{2},x} u(c_{1}, c_{2}, x)
\end{equation}
subject to
\begin{equation}
c_{1} + (c_{2} + n b_{2})/(1+r) = w a + b
\end{equation}
and
\begin{equation}
x = w_{h}a_{h}+ b_{2}
\end{equation}
Here $x$ is the ``expected'' per-heir income during the heir's working life.%
\footnote{%
This is the proxy for per-heir ``welfare'',
so the utility function includes altruism toward heirs.
Equal division of the total bequest among heirs is assumed.
} % see Shorrocks 1979, Becker 1981
%

NOTE: in simulation, there is \emph{household} utility maximization
based on \emph{household} resources (and average household ability).
See p.412.
This matters, since husband and wife may have different resources and abilities.


Problem: How to determine $x$?
(Heirs' wage and ability unknown at time of consumer decision.)

Pestieau solution (p.409): set $w_{h}=w$ and $a_{h}=a$.
So $E[a_t+1]$ should be govenened by Pestieau (3), but is not.
That is, each heir is ``expected'' to have the same income as the (parthenogenic) parent.

Problem: Functional form for utility?

Pestieau solution:
\begin{equation}\label{utility_fn}
u(c_{1}, c_{2}, x) = x^{\alpha} c_{1}^{\gamma} c_{2}^{1-\alpha-\gamma}
\end{equation}
or equivalently
\begin{equation}\label{ln_utility_fn}
\tilde{u}(c_{1}, c_{2}, x) = \alpha \ln x +\gamma \ln c_{1} + (1-\alpha-\gamma) \ln c_{2}
\end{equation}
%claims Pestieau and Posen show separability result


So we up with
\begin{equation}
\max_{c_{1}, c_{2}, b_{2}}
\alpha \ln (wa+ b_{2})
+ \gamma \ln c_{1}
+ (1-\alpha-\gamma) \ln c_{2}
+ \lambda [ (w a + b) - c_{1} - (c_{2} + n b_{2})/(1+r)]
\end{equation}
with first order conditions
\begin{gather}
\alpha/(wa+b_{2}) = \lambda n/(1+r)\label{dL/db2}
\\
\gamma/c_{1} = \lambda \label{dL/dc1}
\\
(1-\alpha-\gamma)/ c_{2} = \lambda / (1+r) \label{dL/dc2}
\end{gather}


/*

Substituting for $\lambda$, it follows that
\begin{gather}
\alpha/(wa+b_{2}) = \gamma n/ c_{1} (1+r)
\\
(1-\alpha-\gamma)/ c_{2} = \gamma / c_{1} (1+r)  \implies  c_{2} = c_{1} (1-\alpha-\gamma)(1+r)/\gamma
\end{gather}
which together imply
\begin{equation}
c_{2} = (wa+b_{2})n(1-\alpha-\gamma)/\alpha \implies n b_{2} = \alpha c_{2} /(1-\alpha-\gamma)  - nwa
\end{equation}
We can therefore use the budget constraint to solve for $c_{2}$.
Substituting in the constraint for $c_{1}$ and $b_{2}$ yields
\begin{equation}
(w a + b) = \gamma c_{2}/(1-\alpha-\gamma)(1+r) + c_{2}/(1+r) + \alpha c_{2}/(1-\alpha-\gamma)(1+r) - nwa/(1+r)
\end{equation}
so we solve for
\begin{equation}
c_{2} = (1-\alpha-\gamma)[b + wa(1+r+n)]
\end{equation}

*/


Ooops.  Try again.
Alternative derivation: solve for $b_{2}$ and $c_{2}$ in terms of $c_{1}$\\
Substituting for $\lambda$, it follows that
\begin{gather}
\alpha/(wa+b_{2}) = \gamma n/ c_{1} (1+r) \implies b_{2} = c_{1} (1+r) \alpha /\gamma n - wa
\\
(1-\alpha-\gamma)/ c_{2} = \gamma / c_{1} (1+r)  \implies  c_{2} = c_{1}(1+r) (1-\alpha-\gamma)/\gamma
\end{gather}
We can therefore use the budget constraint to solve for $c_{1}$.
Note that
\begin{equation}
c_{2} + n b_{2} = c_{1}(1+r)(1-\gamma)/\gamma - nwa
\end{equation}
Substituting in the constraint for $c_{2} + n b_{2}$ yields
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
(w a + b)
&= c_{1} + [c_{1}(1+r)(1-\gamma)/\gamma - nwa]/(1+r)
\\
&= c_{1}/\gamma - nwa/(1+r)
\end{split}
\end{equation}

solving the equation above for $c_{1}$ we get:
\begin{equation}\label{simulation c_1}
c_{1} = \gamma[b + wa + \frac{naw}{1+r}]
\end{equation}

Note that (\ref{simulation c_1}) will be utilized in the simulation model.  However, (\ref{simulation c_1}) is easily simplified to resemble Pestieau (p.409, fn. 15) as follows:

\begin{equation}
c_{1} = \gamma[b + wa\frac{1+r+n} {1+r}] \implies
(1+r)c_{1} = \gamma(1+r)(b + wa) + \gamma wan
\end{equation}
Recalling that we expressed $b_{2}$ and $c_{2}$ in terms of $c_{1}$, we therefore have
\begin{gather}
b_{2} =  [b(1+r) + wa(1+r+n)] \alpha /n - wa \implies nb_{2} = \alpha(1+r)(b+wa) - (1-\alpha)wan
\\
\begin{split}
c_{2} = [b(1+r) + wa(1+r+n)] (1-\alpha-\gamma) &= (1-\alpha-\gamma)(1+r)(b+wa) + (1-\alpha-\gamma)wan
\\
&= (1-\alpha -\gamma)[b+wa+\frac{naw}{1+r}](1+r)
\\
&= (1-\alpha -\gamma)[b+wa\frac{1+r+n}{1+r}](1+r)
\end{split}
\end{gather}
This confirms Pestieau (p.409, fn. 15), except for the capital stock measure,
which apparently assumes a single aggregate consumer.\newline

(KC: In the theory model I understand that each individual makes bequest/consumption decisions independently.  I understand that there will be a singe aggregate \emph{household} consumer in the simulation model.  That is, in the simulation model, $K_{t+1}$ represents a household's contribution to the capital stock (savings) for next period; in the theory model $K_{t+1}$ is an individuals savings which is a contribution to the next period capital stock.)\newline

More safely:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
s
&= b + aw - c_{1}
\\
&= b + aw - \gamma[b + wa \frac{1+r+n}{1+r}]
\\
&= (1-\gamma)(b+wa) - wa \gamma \frac{n}{1+r}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

So more correctly (right??)  %chk
\begin{equation}
K_{t+1} = N_{t} s_{t}
\end{equation}
where only the young are saving.\newline

(KC: I am not sure what $N_{t}$ above represents.  If $N_t$ is the number working couples in generation t, I don't think that we can say: $K_{t+1} = N_{t} s_{t}$.  This implies that each couple's contribution to the capital stock is the same.  This is not true because of ability differences and hence income differences. Similarly, the same would be true if $N_{t}$ represents the number of individuals in their first period of life.)\newline

Review this:
$E[r_t] = r_{t-1}$ in deriving (Pestieau 11',  p.409)
Knows number of kids he'll have!!
BUT: uncertain of kids abilities.
(Expects own ability reproduced; not RE!)\newline

(KC: in deriving 11', p.409 $E[a_{t+1}]=\beta \bar{a}+(1-\beta)=1$ (equation 4 p.407).  That is, the expectation of ones heirs ability is equal to expectation of the process generating their ability. So in the theory model parents know the number of children they will have, but are unsure of his/her ability.  Expected ability is governed by the equation which determines ability.)\newline

Second period p.408:
retired,
bears $n$ heirs,
leaves $b_{2}$ to each heir at \emph{beginning} of second period,
for total bequest of $b_{2} \cdot n$.
No parthenogenesis: each heir receives $b_{2}$.
(This is effectively intervivos transfers;
constrast simulation: end of period?)\newline

KC: Notes from the Diamond model concerning rent payments p.1130\newline
\textbf{First Period:} t\newline
indiv works, receives wage(=MPL), allocates income between two periods (no bequests) via u-max.\newline
Consumption decisions based on the ``rate of interest for one-period loans from period $t$ to period $t+1$, $r_{t+1}$.  Thus the members of the younger generation make up the supply side of the capital market."\newline
Individual consumes difference between his/her wage and quantity he lends to capital market.  (Since there are no bequests in this model we do not have guidance regarding rents on inherited wealth for period t).\newline
\noindent\textbf{Second Period:} t+1 \newline
The same indiv consumes savings plus accrued interest: $(1+r_{t+1})s_t$, where $s_t$ is the amount saved in the first period.  So here it looks like rents on $s_t$ are eared from period $t$ until $t+1$, then are paid/received at the beginning/end(?) of period $t+1$.  (It is not possible to say when in $t+1$ that rent payments are made from the text.  However, doesn't $s_t$ have to stick around long enough to serve as the capital in production in $t+1$?  That is, consumption must occur again after production.)

Simulation steps:
\begin{verbatimtab}
Possible simultaneity problems:
        young cd need to know w,b to supply labor -> N -> Y
                soln: labor supply inelastic
        firm income (Y) required to pay wages and rents
                soln: first produce, then pay
Timing issue:
        old rec rents and *then* leave bequest to young

Initial round:
        Given: 100 young, K0
        So it's like the young already own the K0??

Sounds like sequence is based on Pryor (1973).
(But in Pryor, the initial generation receives both wage and property income.)
        work
        get pd
        marry
        consume/save

KC: the first period aren't the owners of capital just the young? -> initial capital = initial wealth
AI: Sort of.  We need a consistent treatment.  I think that means the young *receive* the capital
    in the first period, just like young receive "bequests" (i.e., inter vivos transfers) in other
    periods.  But this begs the question: to whom are the rents paid in the initial period?
    I see no coherent answer to this, if the old receive the rents every other period,
    and I do not see an alternative to that.  Right?

Consider period t:
Preliminary: oldold die, oldyoung bear newcohort, oldyoung become old, newcohort becomes young
Production
Factor Payments (wages to young, rents to old)
Old leave "bequests" (i.e. itervivos transfers)
young marry and save (young must marry *after* w, a, and b determined, for class marriage)

Still the oddity:
At the beginning of the period the old own the capital stock (->no owners first period??)

Factor payments:
        Old receive rents (but there are no old initially!?)
        Young receive wage
Then (?) the old
        consume (rest is bequests)
        die and leave bequests
Then (?) the young
        marry
        consume
        save
So at the end of the period the young own the capital stock,
which they carry to the next period as saving.

Note the odd timing for consumption

Old bear kids
Young marry (form households)
Determine w, N in labor market (*household* umax)
Produce (K pred; N) -> Y
        distribute Y to owners of factors
                pay rents to current old
                pay wages to current young
        bequests and saving (consumption is residual)
                old leave bequests
                young save
\end{verbatimtab}
Comment: class marriage seems to be the best match to the parthenogenic theoretical model.

Question: is ``lifetime income'' b+wa (i.e., does it include bequests)?  Assuming yes.
